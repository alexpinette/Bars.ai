Miranda Lambert,Mama's Broken Heart by Miranda Lambert,"
I cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors
I screamed his name 'til the neighbors called the cops
I numbed the pain at the expense of my liver
Don’t know what I did next, all I know I couldn’t stop

Word got around to the barflies and the baptists
My mama’s phone started ringin' off the hook
I can hear her now, sayin' she ain’t gonna have it
Don’t matter how you feel, it only matters how you look

Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart

Wish I could be just a little less dramatic
Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Leave it to me to be holding the matches
When the fire trucks show up and there’s nobody else to blame

Can’t get revenge and keep a spotless reputation
Sometimes revenge's just a choice you gotta make
My mama came from a softer generation
Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face

Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart

Powder your nose, paint your toes
Line your lips and keep 'em closed
Cross your legs, dot your eyes
And never let 'em see you cry

Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart"
Miranda Lambert,Tin Man by Miranda Lambert,"
Hey there, Mr. Tin Man
You don't know how lucky you are
You shouldn't spend your whole life wishin'
For something bound to fall apart
Every time you're feeling empty
Better thank your lucky stars
If you ever felt one breaking
You'd never want a heart

Hey there, Mr. Tin Man
You don't know how lucky you are
I've been on the road that you're on
It didn't get me very far
You ain't missing nothing
'Cause love is so damn hard
Take it from me, darling
You don't want a heart

Hey there, Mr. Tin Man
I'm glad we talked this out
You can take mine if you want it
It's in pieces now
By the way there, Mr. Tin Man
If you don't mind the scars
You give me your armor
And you can have my heart"
Miranda Lambert,Vice by Miranda Lambert,"
Sting of the needle dropping on a vinyl
Neon singer with a jukebox title full of heartbreak
33, 45, 78
When it hurts this good you gotta play it twice
Another vice

All dressed up in a pretty black label
Sweet salvation on a dining room table
Waiting on me
Where the numb meets the lonely
It's gone before it ever melts the ice

Another vice, another call
Another bed I shouldn't crawl out of
At 7 AM with shoes in my hand
Said I wouldn't do it, but I did it again
And I know I'll be back tomorrow night, oh

I wear a town like a leather jacket
When the new wears off, I don't even pack it
If you need me
I'll be where my reputation don't precede me
Maybe I'm addicted to goodbyes

Another vice, another town
Where my past can't run me down
Another life, another call
Another bed I shouldn't crawl out of
At 7 AM with shoes in my hand
Said I wouldn't do it, but I did it again
And I know I'll be gone tomorrow night
Mm, another vice

Standing at the sink, not looking in the mirror
Don't know where I am or how I got here
Well, the only thing that I know how to find
Is another vice

Mm, another vice
Yes, another vice
Ooh, another vice
Another vice
Another vice
Another vice"
Miranda Lambert,Little Red Wagon by Miranda Lambert,"
You only love me for my big sunglasses
And my Tony Lamas
And my Dodge Dart Classic
You said ""I'll be Johnny and you'll be June
I'll ride with you to the moon""
But guess what?

You can't ride in my little red wagon
The front seat's broken and the axle's draggin'
You can't step to this backyard swagger
You know it ain't my fault when I'm walkin' jaws droppin' like
Ohhhh
Ahhhh
Ohhhh
Ahh

Oh, heaven help me
I been sowwin' wildflower seeds
And chasin' tumbleweeds
But that's just who I be
And you're just tryin' to slow this rolling stone
But I'm on to you babe
So guess what?

You can't ride in my little red wagon
The front seat's broken and the axle's draggin'
You can't step to this backyard swagger
You know it ain't my fault when I'm walkin' jaws droppin' like
Ohhhh
Ahhhh
Ohhhh
Ahh

Oh, you only love me for my big sunglasses and my Tony Lamas
I live in Oklahoma
And I've got long, blonde hair
And I play guitar and I go on the road
And I do all the shit you wanna do
And my dog does tricks
And I ain't about drama y'all
I love my apron
But I ain't your momma
So guess what?
What?!
You can't ride in my little red wagon
The front seat's broken and the axle's draggin'
You can't step to this backyard swagger
You know it ain't my fault when I'm walkin' jaws droppin' like

Miranda Lambert,Somethin' Bad by Miranda Lambert (Ft. Carrie Underwood),"
Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen

Pulled up to the church but I got so nervous
Had to back it on up, couldn't make it to the service
Grabbed all the cash underneath my mattress
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen

Ran into a girl in a pretty white dress
Rolled down a window
Where you headed to next?
Said I'm heading to the
bayou
with my money out of the mattress
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen

Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen
Drinks keep coming, throw my head back laughing
Wake up in the morning, don't know what happened
Whoa... somethin' bad
Whoa... somethin' bad

Now me and that girl that I met on the street
We're rollin' down the road, down to New Orleans
Got a full tank of gas and the money out of the mattress
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen

Bout to tear it up down in New Orleans
Just like a real-life Thelma and Louise
If the cops catch up, they're gonna call it kidnapping
Got a real good feelin' somethin' bad about to happen

Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen
Drinks keep coming, throw my head back laughing
Wake up in the morning, don't know what happened
Whoa... somethin' bad
Whoa... somethin' bad
Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen
Drinks keep coming, throw my head back laughing
Wake up in the morning, don't know what happened

Whoa... somethin' bad
Whoa... somethin' bad"
Miranda Lambert,Bluebird by Miranda Lambert,"
Ooh
Ooh

Yeah,  I'm a turner
I turn pages all the time
Don't like where I'm at
34  was bad, so I just turn to 35
Yeah,  I'm a keeper
I keep digging down for the deep
Like  the records I'm playing
They might keep you waiting
But you know I'm only playing for keeps

And if the house just keeps on winning
I  got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love keeps giving me lemons
I'll just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart

Ooh
Ooh

Well, I'm a giver
Yeah, and I'm still giving 'em hell
Forgiving's pretty hard
So I made an art out of forgettin' 'em well
Yeah, I'm a rhymer
I can turn 20 cents into a 10
And if I get confused and I start to lose
I rhyme a dime 'til it all makes sense

And if the house just keeps on winning
I got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love keeps giving me lemons
I'll just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I turn a light on in my soul
And keep a bluebird in my heart

Ooh
Ooh
And if the house just keeps on winning
I got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love starts giving me lemons
Just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart
Keep a bluebird in my heart

Ooh
And the bluebird sings

Miranda Lambert,The House That Built Me by Miranda Lambert,"
I know they say, ""You can’t go home again""
I just had to come back one last time
Ma'am, I know you don't know me from Adam
But these hand prints on the front steps are mine
Up those stairs, in that little back bedroom
Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar
And I bet you didn't know under that live oak
My favorite dog is buried in the yard

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it’s like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me

Mama cut out pictures of houses for years
From 'Better Homes and Garden' magazine
Plans were drawn and concrete poured
Nail by nail and board by board
Daddy gave life to Mama's dream

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it’s like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me

You leave home, you move on and you do the best you can
I got lost in this whole world and forgot who I am

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it’s like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could walk around, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me"
Miranda Lambert,Over You by Miranda Lambert,"
Weather man said, it’s gonna snow
By now I should, be used to the cold

Mid-February shouldn’t be so scary
It was only December
I still remember the presents, the tree, you and me

But you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say I’ll be OK
But I’m not going to ever get over you

Living alone, here in this place
I think of you, and I’m not afraid

Your favorite records make me feel better
Cause you sing along
With every song
I know you didn’t mean to give them to me

But you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say I’ll be OK
But I’m not going to ever get over you

It really sinks in, you know, when I see it in stone

Cause you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say I’ll be OK
But I’m not going to ever get over you"
Miranda Lambert,Runnin' Just in Case by Miranda Lambert,"
There's trouble where I'm going
But I'm gonna go there anyway
I hate Sunday mornings
'Cause they always seem to start this way
I'm looking for a lighter
I already bought the cigarettes
Guess I picked me up a habit
On my way out of Lafayette
Eastbound and down
I turn it up 'cause that's sure how I feel
My mind is racing through the pines
My hands are shaky on the steering wheel
I'm going North on 59 but I know good and well
I'm headed South
'Cause me and Birmingham
Don't have a history of working out

What I lost in Louisiana
I found back in Alabama
But nobody ever taught me how to stay
It ain't love that I'm chasing
But I'm running just in case

I ain't unpacked my suitcase
Since the day that I turned twenty one
It's been a long ten years since then
It's getting kinda cumbersome
The first one and the last one
And the one that's got my name in ink
The smoker and the fighter
And the one in every song I sing

What I lost in Lubbock, Texas
I looked for in all the rest
But I guess no one ever taught me how to stay
It ain't love that I'm chasing
But I'm running just in case

I carry them around with me
I don't mind having scars
Happiness ain't prison
But there's freedom in a broken heart"
Miranda Lambert,Settling Down by Miranda Lambert,"
Should I give up sunsets for marigold mornings?
Should I look for rainbows or wait for the rain?
Is happiness on the highway? Or is it parked in the driveway?
Should I lean on you, babe? Or should you lean on me?

Am I looking for comfort? Am I looking for an escape?
Am I looking for you? Am I looking the other way?

I'm a wild child and a homing pigeon
Caravan and an empty kitchen
Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds
One heart goin' both directions
One love and a couple of questions
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?

I could plant a pretty garden or just send myself flowers
Be a jet-set Friday or a Sunday hometown girl
I could stay a little lonely or let you get to know me
Yeah, I could love a picket fence if it wrapped around the world

I'm a wild child and a homing pigeon
Caravan and an empty kitchen
Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds
I'm one heart goin' both directions
One love and a couple of questions
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?

Ooh, ooh, ooh

Am I looking for comfort? Am I looking for an escape?
Am I looking for you? Am I looking the other way?

I'm a wild child and a homing pigeon
A caravan and an empty kitchen
Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds
One heart goin' both directions
One love and a couple of questions
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down? 
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?

It's been a wreck me week
Sixty plus from dawn to dusk
In the red dirt heat
Busting it up for a couple of bucks
But it ain't no thing
Just another day 'til I'm on my way
To them cool, cool sheets and you and me

Working on the night shift, baby
Dying for your touch like crazy
Racking up the overtime hours
Loving how we're working on the night shift, baby

Gonna rock it right
No need to talk, I know what you want
And what you like
'Cause I do too, yeah
I love how you leave on the lights
Not a thing between you and me
And it feels so nice when you and I are

Working on the night shift, baby
Dying for your touch like crazy
Racking up the overtime hours
Loving how we're working on the night shift, baby

Yeah, yeah

Just trying to get paid
Been hotter than a hundred suns

First thing that caught my eye
Lke nothing I'd ever seen
Sunburned auburn air
The California dream
Yeah, she was shaking them hips
To some old motown song
I couldn't say anything
So I sang along

She was a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, she's moving through my mind
I gotta know her name and I gotta see her again
She's got me wondering, yeah I'm just wondering
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?

So I just hung around
This little west coast town
I dropped by every night
I stayed till closing time
My little mystery
That girl is killing me
So I put on a song
Just to sing along

She was a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, she's moving through my mind
I gotta know her name and I gotta see her again
She's got me wondering, yeah I'm just wondering
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
She's got me mesmerized, she's all I'm thinking about
All I think about, think about, think about

So I'm right here right now
Humming this little song
If I could say a thing
I'd want you to know
You were a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, you're moving through my mind
I gotta know your name and I gotta see you again

I could say I don't want it, but I'd be lying

She's got the kind of eyes you wanna get lost in
You're gonna look twice when she gets to walkin'
In a honky tonk with them blue jeans on
She's a cold beer, a whiskey shot, a neon light
A Strait song on the jukebox, a dance all night
What a cowboy wants, a never-do-you-wrong

Nobody leaves a girl like that
Nobody walks away and never looks back
You'd have to be outta your mind
To tell somethin' that good goodbye
Nobody goes and breaks a heart of gold
Once you get a girl like that, you never let her go
Take it from me, nobody leaves a girl like that

I was reckless and wild, didn't think I was ready
Couldn't settle me down, so I fired up my Chevy
I was stubborn and she was cryin'
Well, she knew she couldn't stop me, but she kept right on tryin'

Nobody leaves a girl like that
Nobody walks away and never looks back
You'd have to be outta your mind
To tell somethin' that good goodbye
Nobody goes and breaks a heart of gold
Once you get a girl like that, you never let her go
Take it from me, nobody leaves a girl like that

She's the kind of girl that only comes around once
Well, she found somebody new and I'm goin' crazy because

Nobody leaves a girl like that
Nobody walks away and never looks back
You'd have to be outta your mind
To tell somethin' that good goodbye
Nobody goes and breaks a heart of gold
Once you get a girl like that, you never let her go
Take it from me, nobody leaves

Up there in that starlight, starlight tonight

Runnin' down this dream
Up against this road
Sometimes the only thing that I got
Keeps me movin' on
Right where I need to be
No matter where I go
Never too far from home

Up there in that starlight, starlight tonight
Oh, tonight

To the good that die young
Fighters for the freedom fought that keeps me free
And all the heroes in my heart who taught me to believe
And that's why I believe in things I can't see

Shinin' down on me, showing me the way
Angel in the night here to save the day
Like a light out of the dark, straight across the sky
Up there in that starlight, starlight tonight
Yeah, up there in that starlight, starlight tonight
Yeah, tonight
Shinin' down on me"
Scotty McCreery,Five More Minutes by Scotty McCreery,"
Eight years old, a couple cane poles
Sittin' down by the creek
Our lines in the water, watching those bobbers
Seein' that red sun sink
Mama's on the porch yelling ""Supper's hot
Y'all come and get it!""
We yelled five more minutes

At sixteen it was twelve o three
Standin' at her front door
Katie's dad said midnight
But we needed just a little more
Yellow light flipping on and off
Interruptin' that goodnight kissing
We wanted five more minutes

Time rolls by, the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh, but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those, Lord knows I'd hit it
And give myself five more minutes

At eighteen, turned my helmet in
And walked to the fifty-yard line
It's just the coach and me after we
Lost state, ten to nine
And I cried, ""Man next time to get in here
I'll have to buy a ticket""
Can't you give me five more minutes?

Time rolls by, the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh, but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those, Lord knows I'd hit it
And give myself five more minutes
At eighty-six, my grandpa said
There's angels in the room
With all the family gathered 'round
We knew that time was coming soon
With so much left to say I prayed
Lord, I ain't finished
Just give us five more minutes

Time rolls by, the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh, but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those, Lord knows I'd hit it
Yeah, sometimes this old life will leave you wishing
That you had five more minutes
Five more minutes"
Scotty McCreery,This Is It by Scotty McCreery,"
Way up in the mountains, four thousand feet high
There's a trail through the trees to a cliff where Carolina meets the sky
Oh, and there's a view I just can't describe
No, we're not there yet, just a few more steps, baby wait
Okay, you can open your eyes

This is it, this is now, this is what I've been talking 'bout
Looking out, can't you see forever?
Take my hand, just take it in
This is a moment we won't forget
On top of the world, here, together
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss, this is it

Girl, I know that you've been waiting and talking to your friends
Wondering if and wondering where and wondering when
Well, I've been waiting too, holding on to this ring
For the right words to say, for the right time and place, for me to get on one knee

This is it, this is now, this is what I've been talking 'bout
Looking out, can't you see forever?
Take my hand, just take it in
This is a moment we won't forget
On top of the world here together
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss, well this is it
This is it

Now you're walking down the aisle
And I can't help but smile

This is it, this is now, it's what I've been talking 'bout
Looking out, I can see forever
So take my hand, just take it in 
This is a moment we won't forget 
On top of the world, here, together
Surrounded by our family and our friends
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss
This is it
Yeah, this is it"
Scotty McCreery,The Trouble with Girls by Scotty McCreery,"
The trouble with girls is they’re a
mystery
Something about ’em
puzzles me
Spent my whole life
trying to figure out
Just what them girls are all about
The trouble with girls
is they're so dang pretty
Everything about ’em
does something to me
But I guess that’s the way it’s supposed to be

They smile, that smile
They bat those eyes
They steal you with ""hello""
They kill you with ""goodbye""
They hook you with one touch and you can’t break free
Yeah, the trouble with girls is nobody loves trouble as much as me

They’re sugar and spice and angel wings
And hell on wheels and tight blue jeans
A summer night, down by the lake
An old memory that you can’t shake
They’re hard to find, yet there’s so many of ’em
The way that you hate, that you already love ’em
But I guess that’s the way it’s supposed to be

They smile, that smile
They bat those eyes
They steal you with ""hello""
They kill you with ""goodbye""
They hook you with one touch and you can’t break free
Yeah, the trouble with girls is nobody loves trouble as much as me

The way they hold you out on the dance floor
The way they ride in the middle of your truck
The way they give you a kiss at the front door
Leave you wishing you could have gone up
And just as you walk away
You hear that sweet voice say…
Stay
They smile, that smile
They bat those eyes
They steal you with ""hello""
They kill you with ""goodbye""
They hook you with one touch and you can’t break free
Yeah, the trouble with girls is nobody loves trouble as much as me"
Scotty McCreery,Christmas In Heaven by Scotty McCreery,"
December hasn't changed
This town looks the same
They still light that tree in the city square
There's red, white, and green shining everywhere
And I wish you were here
And I wonder

Is the snow falling down on the streets of gold
Are the mansions all covered in white
Are you singing with angels ""Silent Night""
I wonder what Christmas in heaven is like

There's a little manger  scene
Down on Third and Main
I must have walked right by it a thousand times
But I see it now in a different light
'Cause I know you are there
And I wonder
Are you kneeling with shepherds before him now
Can you reach out and touch his face
Are you part of that glorious Holy night
I wonder what Christmas in Heaven is like

Scotty McCreery,I Love You This Big by Scotty McCreery,"
I know I'm still young
But, I know how I feel
I might not have too much experience
But, I know when love is real
By the way my heart starts pounding
When I look into your eyes
I might look a little silly
Standing with my arms stretched open wide

I love you this big
Eyes have never seen this big
No-one's ever dreamed this big
And I'll spend the rest of my life
Explaining what words cannot describe but, I'll try
I love you this big

I'll love you to the moon and back
I'll love you all the time
Deeper than the ocean
And higher than the pines
Because girl, you do something to me
Deep down in my heart
I know I look a little crazy
Standing with my arms stretched all apart


So much bigger than I ever dreamed my heart ever would
I love you this big
And I'd write your name in stars across the sky
If I could, I would

Been a while since I felt this way
But it's a brand new me, yeah it's a brand new day
Can't keep a man down when he's on the way up
Can't keep it in park when there's gas in the truck

Just when you think you can't make it through the rain
Your seasons change, oh

When you just can't find the right piece to the puzzle
There's no light at the end of the tunnel
Don't sweat it, don't fret it, put your boots on the ground
It'll come back around
'Cause sometimes going through all the bad weather
Makes the sun shine that much better
Right here right now is what it's all about

And it feels like a thousand days
Since I seen that smile, heard that laugh
Felt that touch I've been needing so bad
And the only way to get there fast

Taking it slow, doing 35 down Timber drive

Sweet tea, porch swings, supper on the stove
Everything I've been missing on the road
I can't be there tonight

I'm going home in my mind

Just needing you to hold me
Hung up in a hotel

Holding you so tight under that porch light

On my phone, on my dash—all over the place

Just to see that little smile in real life

You're worth the drive

The one life that I have
The chances, they come, and the chances, they go

And I told Mr. Walker just go home
Why do the demons in my mind
Never wanna leave me alone?
It's the pistol and the bottle
It's the drugs and it's the throttle
They tell me they'll make me feel alive
But I know good and well that ain't gonna help
I'm just praying, praying I make it through the night

Well, I'd love to get to sleep, but I can't get too deep
Though I'm doing the best that I can
My mind wants to talk about everything I'm not
Even worse, everything I am
I tell my friends and they tell me that
Time will only do me well
But I won't shut my mouth, is it a rule down in the south
That you can't talk about your mental health?

We didn't get our books
In bed every night
We're dancing in the kitchen
Drunk off of some shitty wine
I didn't get that ring
There on my hand
I didn't get your name
In ink all over my skin

Even I, don't like, who I've been lately
And I'm well, aware, that I might not ever find loving
But like Hemingway and Hadley, it's not the end of our story

Sit here tonight
Alone with my thoughts
Alone with my sins
And the things that I've bought
I told you I loved you
The night that we met
I felt it back then

Morgan Wade,Last Cigarette by Morgan Wade,"Tell me the truth: Is it over for you?
It isn't for me, but I'll say what you want me to say
Addiction is strong, I know it's wrong
But I need that high, I ain't gonna lie
Give me tonight. So I can be alright
I can hold your body and you can hold mine
I want you one last time
Another hit to ease my mind
I don't want you to be over yet
Won't you be my last cigarette?
I thought it took three times
To burn into my mind
But, I had you once
And you threw a punch
But I'm not too mad
All the fun that we had
But it's hard to let go-
It's so hard to say no
I can't go all day
My hands, they shake
I've gone off the deep side
Habits gonna make me die
I want you one last time
Another hit to ease my mind
I don't want you to bе over yet
Won't you be my last cigarеtte?
So, you want better now
So, you gotta lay me down
But don't go, not yet
Wanna wake up with you on my breath
I want you one last time
Another hit to ease my mind
I don't want you to be over yet
Won't you be my last cigarette?"
Morgan Wade,Wilder Days by Morgan Wade,"
Hand in my hair and you said I looked pretty
You're so devious, rode in
From the Windy City
I ain't gotta clear view
Tell me what you want me to do and
Tell me every single secret in your mind
Come on, baby, we got nothing but time
You say, I'm too young for you
You're scared I'm too right for you

You said you hate the smell of cigarette smoke
You only used to smoke when you drank
When you lived in Chicago
Unsure where the wind blows
I wish I'd known you in your wilder days
And now here we go
You got me falling in love again
You gotta secret, I wanna keep it
I wish I'd known you in your wilder days

The way you move your hands across my body
Kissing you in a hotel lobby
Baby  I don't wanna lose this feeling
You're giving me something to believe in
And who were you before I knew your name?
Were you drunk at midnight waiting for the train?
You could have been anyone back then
Just another kid reaching for the wind

You said you hate the smell of cigarette smoke
You only use to smoke when you drank
When you lived in Chicago
Unsure where the wind blows
I wish I'd known you in your wilder days
And now here we go
You got me falling in love again
You gotta secret, I wanna keep it
I wish I'd known you in your wilder days

What were you like when you were a little wilder?
Why don't you show me?
Why don't you show me?
What you were like when you got a little higher?
Just for tonight, just for tonight
You said you hate the smell of cigarette smoke
You only use to smoke when you drank
When you lived in Chicago
Unsure where the wind blows
I wish I'd known you in your wilder days
And now here we go
You got me falling in love again
You gotta secret, I wanna keep it
I wish I'd known you in your wilder days
I wish I'd known you in your wilder days
I wish I'd known you in your wilder days"
Morgan Wade,Northern Air by Morgan Wade,"
Didn't know the difference between
What I needed and what I was wanting
And the way you looked at me
Was a little haunting
I can still see you with your whiskey and your ginger
Back of the bar, drunk in early September
But I'm missing you now
I'm still stuck here in this southern town

So tell me
Tell me, how's that northern air
And do you think of me when you're all alone?
Won't you bring yourself on home?

I sang you songs, I wrote about you, didn't even know it
Or maybe you did and you were too afraid to show it
Tonight I wonder if you're by yourself
But I can't imagine you with anyone else

So tell me
Tell me, how's that northern air
And do you think of me when you're all alone?
I could drive all night to be there
'Cause I don't think that I could stand
One more night on my own
Won't you bring yourself on home?

There's a red wine stain on my white dress
That I bought to impress you
That night that I confessed my truth
Didn't know it would upset you
I haven't seen you in so long
But after all this time, these feelings, they're not gone

So tell me
Tell me, how's that northern air
And do you think of me when you're all alone?
I could drive all night to be there
'Cause I don't think that I could stand
One more night on my own
Won't you bring yourself on home?
Won't you bring yourself on home?
Won't you bring yourself on home?
Won't you bring yourself on home?
There's a red wine stain on my white dress
That I bought to impress you"
Old Dominion,Written In the Sand by Old Dominion,"
Turn me on turn me off then you turn me back on by the weekend
And you won’t say the words that I want but you flirt when you’re drinkin’
I see those bubbles pop up like you’re texting then they disappear
Lets cut through the shit then let’s get to what we’re doing here

Are we just a backseat, tryna get it while we can
Are we names in a tattoo, or just a number on a hand
Are we last call kissing or will we be reminiscing with each other for the next forty years
Are we written in the stars, baby, or are we written in the sand

Yeah, I want you to want me to take you back home to my mama
Put my name on your lips call me yours and forget all this drama
Your makeup is next to my toothbrush but you never put it away on the shelf
I'm asking you baby 'cause i’m tired of asking myself

Are we just a backseat, tryna get it while we can
Are we names in a tattoo, or just a number on a hand
Are we last call kissing, are we dancing in the kitchen, baby tell me what it is or what it isn't
Are we written in the stars, baby, or are we written in the sand

Are we just a backseat, tryna get it while we can
Are we names in a tattoo, or just a number I should wash right off my hand
Are we last call kissing or will we be reminiscing with each other for the next forty years
Are we written in the stars baby, or are we written in the sand
Are we written in the stars baby, or are we written in the sand"
Old Dominion,No Such Thing as a Broken Heart by Old Dominion,"
Hey, hey
Keep your chin up
Hey, hey

I wonder if Jack and Diane ever made it
After the drums and the guitars all faded
Was the best they could do good enough?
Or did the heartland just swallow 'em up?
How did my mom and my dad ever do it?
If there was struggles, then we never knew it
I guess they had each other
That was enough

You know you can't keep the ground from shaking
No matter how hard you try
You can't keep the sunsets from fading
You gotta treat your life like you're jumping off a rope swing
Baby 'cause the whole thing's really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart

What am I gonna tell my kids when they see all of this bullshit that goes down on TV?
When the whole world is down on its luck
I gotta make sure they keep their chin up
Cry when it hurts, laugh when it's funny
Chase after the dream, don't chase after the money
And know we got each other
That's what's up

'Cause you can't keep the ground from shaking
No matter how hard you try
You can't keep the sunsets from fading
You gotta treat your life like you're jumping off a rope swing
Baby 'cause the whole thing's really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart

You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart

'Cause you can't keep the ground from shaking
No matter how hard you try
You can't keep the sunsets from fading
You gotta treat your life like you're jumping off a rope swing
Baby 'cause the whole thing's really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love, love, love, love, love 
You gotta love, love, love, love, love 
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart"
Old Dominion,Make It Sweet by Old Dominion,"
I know it's a drag, I know it's a grind
I know that a dollar ain't worth a dime
Just trying to keep up with the Joneses at the end of the block
I know you get tired, I know you get down
I know you get sick of this soul-sucking town
But let's make a little lemonade if lemons is all we got

'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me
I never gotta wonder where my honey be
I ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday night
Seven days a week I got an appetite
The sunset's like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen
Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me
Life is short, make it sweet

Open sky, glimpse of heaven, take the top off the CJ-7
Let that surfside San Anne wind mess up your hair
And let that windshield frame the ocean
Radio keep coast-to-coastin'
If we don't get where we're going baby I don't care
I'm already there

'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me
I never gotta wonder where my honey be
I ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday night
Seven days a week I got an appetite
The sunset's like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen
Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me

Days will be long but the years will fly right by
We'll never be as young as we are tonight
Baby ain't that right, yeah

Old Dominion,One Man Band by Old Dominion,"
Been flyin' solo for so long
Nobody's singin' the harmony
Up there just me and my shadow
No bass, no guitar, no tambourine

And I found you like a melody
You were singin' in the same key as me
We had ‘em dancin' in the streets

I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone, alone
Puttin' miles on a run-down van
Baby, we can take our own show on the road
I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune
We'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby, take my hand
I don't wanna be a one man band
No

I wanna run down your wild dreams
And I wanna chase every high with you
Count every rip in these old jeans
We'll never learn how to sing the blues

If I'm gonna be famous
Girl, I wanna be famous with you
We got our own little groove

I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone, alone
Puttin' miles on a run-down van
Baby, we can take our own show on the road
I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune
We'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby, take my hand
'Cause I don't wanna be a one man band

When the spotlight goes cold, and the curtains come down
The chairs are all stacked, and there's no one around
And nobody's payin', we’ll still be playin'
I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone, alone
Puttin' miles on a run-down van
Baby, we can take our own show on the road
I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune
We'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby, take my hand
'Cause I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a one man band"
Old Dominion,Hotel Key by Old Dominion,"
Well, it was down some street we couldn't even pronounce
We were smoking a little from a half an ounce
The tequila was cheap but the flow we were feeling was real
Neither one of us looking for three little words
Unless those three words were ""do not disturb""
Checkout was supposed to be noon but we slept in 'til three

She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key

Well, I could still see her on the bed sitting Indian style
With my t-shirt on and a half drunk smile
She talked about Austin and how she'd get back there someday
We had the curtains wide open and a song on my phone
We danced by the TV we never turned on
And wondered would anyone miss us if we ran away?
But this isn't one of those stories that ends up that way, no

She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key
Yeah

We left the lights
We left the crowd
We left the world and locked it out
She left a picture in my head
She left the night I can't forget, but

She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key
Yeah, she kept it
She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key
Yeah, she kept it
She kept the hotel key, ooh
She kept the hotel key"

Strictly outta curiosity
What would happen if you got with me?
Kissin' you would hit the spot with me
Come on skip a couple rocks with me

Give me any of your heart tonight
Ain't no reason that we need to be apart tonight
I got something we can start tonight
Lookin' at you girl, it's hard to fight

Those stars need to be wished on
Your skin needs to be kissed on
My eyes baby, they're fixed on you
In your snapback
T-shirt of your favourite rock band
Checkin' your makeup in my Ray Bans
Breakin' hearts like only you can
In your snapback

Come on baby, shoot a smile at me
Midnight selfie on a balcony
A little somethin' for my life screamin'
You're burnin' a hole in my pocket
And we've got the beat, let's drop it

Those stars need to be wished on
Your skin needs to be kissed on
My eyes baby, they're fixed on you
In your snapback
Tattoos, cut-offs, and converse
Singin' along to the song with the wrong words
Every move you make baby it works
In your snapback

Old Dominion,Break Up With Him by Old Dominion,"


Hey girl, wassup
I know it's late but I knew you'd pick it up
Naw, I ain't drunk
Okay, maybe I do have a little buzz, but
That song came on and I just thought
What harm could come from one little call
I know you say you're taken but I say
Girl you're takin' too long

To tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
Is just wasting precious time
Girl you know it can't wait
Rip it off just like a Band-Aid
The way you look at me, girl, you can't pretend
I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him

I know you don't wanna break his heart
But that ain't no good reason to be
Keeping us apart
Look, just tell him it's you, it ain't him
And maybe you can lie to him and say you'll
Still be friends
Whatever you got to say to get through to him
That you ain't in love
C'mon you can't deny that you and I
Kinda fit like a glove

So tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
Is just wasting precious time
Girl you know it can't wait
Rip it off just like a Band-Aid
It ain't my business to be all up in
But I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him
I know that you so done with him
Break up with him, break up with him

You would've hung up by now
If you weren't thinking it too
No pressure whatever
Just do what you gotta do
But if I was you
I'd tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
Is just wasting precious time
Girl you know it can't wait
Just rip it off just like a Band-Aid
Yeah, I know I said it but I'll say it again
I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him
The way you look at me girl you can't pretend
I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him
Just break up with him"
Old Dominion,A Girl Is a Gun by Old Dominion,"
Seems innocent enough when your buying the drinks at the bar and you're both getting loaded
Don't even know just the danger you're in cause you're so caught up in the moment
But you shoot a smile cuts through the smoke
Hits you before you even know

A girl is a gun
She's harder to handle than you think son
You feel safe when you're with her
Think twice before you pull the trigger
She feels good in your hand from the first little spark
But guns shoot bullets and bullets break hearts
Heartbreak's a bitch
She'll kill you with a kiss
So before careful when you're holding one
Cause a girl is a gun

She's cold and she's hot
She's fun but she's not some play thing two dollar pistol
Say the right thing she'll go off with a bang
But be careful cause she kicks a little
Hold her just right don't let her down
You're gonna get hurt if you mess around

A girl is a gun
She's harder to handle than you think son
You feel safe when you're with her
Think twice before you pull the trigger
She feels good in your hand from the first little spark
But guns shoot bullets and bullets break hearts
Heartbreak's a bitch
She'll kill you with a kiss
So before careful when you're holding one
Cause a girl is a gun

Yeah a girl is a gun
She's harder to handle than you think son
You feel safe when you're with her
Think twice before you pull the trigger
She feels good in your hand from the first little spark
But guns shoot bullets and bullets break hearts
Heartbreak's a bitch
She'll kill you with a kiss
So before careful when you're holding one
Cause a girl is a gun
Yeah a girl is a gun"

And then I hope he cheats
Like you did on me

I hope what goes comes all the way around
I hope she makes you feel the same way about her
That I feel about you right now
I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy 
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans

Like He promised, like He said on that day

Me from amazing grace

When I was stuck inside my sin in shame
You pursued me though I spit in Your face
Nothing I could ever do to change
'Til You changed me 
'Til You died in my place

Nothing can separate
Me from amazing grace
Jesus, You're all that I need 
If everything falls apart
And I don't know where to start

I bet you already caught everything in it
I bet you're makin' everybody laugh with your jokes
I know you're holdin' nothin' but the best kind of hope
Shinin' a light up there with a big old smile, yeah
And meanwhile

Down home
Oh, you know Mama's still cookin'
Them down home grits
I promise I'm workin'
With this guitar about as hard as I can
I met a girl, bought a house, I put a nice little paymеnt

Is still where my hеart is
This down home kid is just how you left him
I still hate that you're gone
I wish you were here
But I hope I'm making you proud
'Cause I know you're up there lookin' down home

There ain't a day down here that goes by
That I don't climb up in my F-150
On a backroad bumpin' Charley Pride
Yeah, every song keeps you right here with me
I got a daughter now, I really you'd have met
And she's walking now but I know you see every step
I wear the number fifteen every chance I get
So when you're lookin' through the clouds, Daddy
You can bet

That down home
Oh, you know Mama's still cookin'
Them down home grits

MacKenzie Porter,If You Ask Me To by MacKenzie Porter,"
People whisper behind our back
But we're too young to run this fast
But I'd run through a burning house for you
If you asked me to

If we're the dark horse, I'd place my bet
If we're roulette we'll put it all on red
'Cause red is the colour I'd bleed for you
If you asked me to

I want a love that grows, like a tall jack pine
And I wanna grow old with your hand in mine
Down that road, I'd walk with you
Baby if you ask me to
Baby if you ask me to

If there's a river, long and wide
And you were stranded on the other side
Well, I'd swim that raging river for you
If you asked me to

I want a love that grows, like a tall jack pine
And I wanna grow old with your hand in mine
Down that road, I'd walk with you
Baby if you ask me to
Baby if you ask me to

Tie me a circle from a piece of string
And I will wear it as your ring
No, there ain't nothing I wouldn't give to you

MacKenzie Porter,These Days by MacKenzie Porter,"
We were one drag off a cigarette
No, we didn't smoke but we wanted to be cool
We were small town kids all vintage
Just a couple hallway famous fools
We were way over confident
We were in love and lovin’ it
We were radio junkies, throwback country
Suckers for the old school

I'm thinking 'bout those days, these days
I’m thinking 'bout the '98 Chevrolet
Fake ID's, low-key dive bars
The back streets, back seats, and parked cars
I'm thinkin' of breakfast at midnight
Those matching tattoos and goodbyes
Do you think about those days these days, baby like I do?
'Cause I'm thinking about you
Do you think about those days, these days?
’Cause I’m thinking about you
Do you think about those days, these days?

There's a taste of you kiss me when you sip whisky
Take you back to seventeen
Every time you smell sunscreen baby
Do you see me dancing on a Bama beach?
Do you smile at the thought of it?
Do you ever just reminisce when you see an old photo
Wishing it was more then just another TBT?

Over the mighty missipi roads
The squeaking of the steel
Don't care how I feel
Or If I'm ready to go

So, I close my eyes and I start to dream
I throw a nickel in the time machine
Until I taste the wine
Feel your hand in mine
But this time no one's there

I wish I'd known
But nobody told me
That was the last time you were ever gonna hold me
Maybe I'd a held on a little bit longer
Like I was never gonna let you go
Oh
I wish I'd known
I wish I'd known

Wouldn't wait a little longer in your bed
Held on tighter to the words you said
Slowly falling out of your beautiful mouth
Where's the time that we had lost?

I wish I'd known
But nobody told me
That was the last time you were ever gonna hold me
Maybe I'd a held on a little bit longer

You hung up you hat 'cause
Sticks and stones have overgrown

Even if you want to
I’m never gonna let you

So throw your tantrum
Then go and throw all your garbage away
Get rid of yesterday
Pick yourself up
Then fill your half empty cup up with faith
It’s gonna be okay

When I caught you looking

A little smile, a little how you been
A little touch, a little reminisce
It always starts off innocent

But after a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye, given up at two
If we didn't wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh, after a few

We always take it way too far
Where it's too much to resist
We always make it way too hard
To walk away after that third kiss

We pretend that we'll be fine
Through the sting of the morning light
'Cause it happens every time

Imma call her Abby, that’s anybody but you
She’ll have a bad little body, be the life of the party, drink a cold beer too
Won’t make me, go crazy, like you-know-who

Travis Denning,Beer’s Better Cold by Travis Denning,"
I know two lanes roll a little slower
Than a wide-open four-wide highway
Every day, everybody gets older
And every break ain't gonna fall my way
Church gets out at twelve, no later
And while I'm rambling all about no-brainers

Beer's better cold, deuces always fold
Green herons fly south for the winter
Levi's fade, it's hotter in the shade
In a Georgia July than December
Yeah, a touchdown's six, seven with a kick
A good song hits home and it's always gonna be like that
Yeah, it's just a fact that beer's better cold
And she ain't comin' back

Yeah, a last kiss always lasts longer
In your head than it does on your lips
She'll be my one that got away, long-goner
And it's just as obvious as

Beer's better cold, deuces always fold
Green herons fly south for the winter
Levi's fade, it's hotter in the shade
In a Georgia July than December
Yeah, a touchdown's six, seven with a kick
A good song hits home and it's always gonna be like that
Yeah, it's just a fact that beer's better cold
And she ain't comin' back

To these arms, back to this town
Back down those I ain't ever comin' back around roads
No, it don't take Einstein to know

Yeah, beer's better cold, deuces always fold
Green herons fly south for the winter
Levi's fade, it's hotter in the shade
In a Georgia July than December
Yeah, a touchdown's six, seven with a kick
A good song hits home and it's always gonna be like that
Yeah, it's just a fact that beer's better cold
Yeah, beer's better cold and she ain't comin' back
No, she ain't comin' back"
Travis Denning,Heartbeat of a Small Town by Travis Denning,"
Friday night, home team, marching band
Whole crowd stomping in the stands
You can hear them pads popping a mile away
Just down the road there’s Kenwood sub
Shaking the door of a black half-ton
Can’t hear the words, but you can feel that bass

Heartbeat of a small town
Soundtrack to a sundown
Pumpin’ like a freight train
Runnin’ through these red-white-’n’-blue-collar veins
Southern wind blowin’ through pine trees
Coke can poppin’ in the backseat
Nothin’ like that middle of nowhere sound
Heartbeat of a small town
Heartbeat of a small town

Cellphone buzzin’ up on the dash
Baby sayin’,”Boy where you at?”
Goodyears hummin’ down the road to her place
And that whiskey whisper says”pull it over”
Sound of that gravel when you hit the shoulder
Chest poundin’ like that Chevy V8

Heartbeat of a small town
Soundtrack to a sundown
Pumpin’ like a freight train
Runnin’ through these red-white-’n’-blue-collar veins
Southern wind blowin’ through pine trees
Coke can poppin’ in the backseat
Nothin’ like that middle of nowhere sound
Heartbeat of a small town
Heartbeat of a small town

That five o’clock whistle screaming
Sunday morning church bells ringing
Heartbeat of a small town
Soundtrack to a sundown
Pumpin’ like a freight train
Runnin’ through these red-white-’n’-blue-collar veins
Southern wind blowin’ through pine trees
Coke can poppin’ in the backseat
Nothin’ like that middle of nowhere sound
Heartbeat of a small town
Heartbeat of a small town
Heartbeat of a small town
Heartbeat of a small town"
Travis Denning,Where That Beer’s Been by Travis Denning,"
I don't know who bottled it up or who put on that label
All I know is I ordered it up and it's sittin' on my table
Who knows how many trucks it hitched a ride on
How many shelves it spent the night on
'Fore they put it on ice
And put it on my tab tonight?

I don't know where that beer's been, but I know where it's goin'
Into my hand, up to my lips second I crack it open
Gonna tip it, sip it, crush it, kill it, get my sideways showin'
I don't know where that beer's been, but I know where
I know where it's goin'

Could've been brewed in Colorado, Milwaukee, or St. Louie
But the only thing on my mind right now is what it's gonna do to me

I don't know where that beer's been, but I know where it's goin'
Into my hand, up to my lips second I crack it open
Gonna tip it, sip it, crush it, kill it, get my sideways showin'
I don't know where that beer's been, but I know where it's goin'

Down the hatch to my brain 'til I don't know my last name
Up in the air, clankin' loud
When it's gone, there's another one goin' down

I don't know where that beer's been, but I know where it's goin'
Into my hand, up to my lips second I crack it open
Gonna tip it, sip it, crush it, kill it, get my sideways showin'

Travis Denning,Pickup Lines by Travis Denning,"
I pulled up in that two-tone single cab me and Dad fixed
Four by four with a four inch lift
Just high enough that I had to help her in
Maybe it was that cracked windshield but I couldn't see
Where that goin’ nowhere ride would lead
I sure didn't think it would end with a kiss
'Til it did

Could’ve been the right song came on the radio
The first time she got to drive off road
And got her holdin' on to me that night
It could've been the Glasspack twin-stacked tailpipes
Still don't know why she fell for my sun beach bench seat
Four-wheel-drive don't lie pick-up lines

I don't remember those words I said comin' out smooth
But I must've been makin’ all the right moves right up to my favorite part
Where she said throw it in park

Could’ve been the right song came on the radio
The first time she got to drive off road
And got her holdin' on to me that night
It could’ve been the Glasspack twin-stacked tailpipes
Still don't know why she fell for my sun beach bench seat
Four-wheel-drive don't lie pick-up lines, yeah

Yeah, well that full moon is sneakin' through the back glass
We set the night on fire with a half tank of gas

Catching that

Walker Hayes,Don’t Let Her by Walker Hayes,"
She always said if something ever
Happened to me, she would never
Fall in love again, oh, what a waste
We always said we go together
But if I'm just half of her forever
This goes out to whoever takes my place

She don't give two sips 'bout money
Likes a little coffee in her honey
Let her sleep late as she wants
Home is her favorite restaurant
Don't you dare come home if you're hammered
Better watch your mouth and your grammar
She loves babies, hates glitter
You better shave 'fore you kiss her
And if she ever misses me
Please, don't let her

She's insecure about her legs, right?
Something wrong with her hair, right?
Just tell her she's crazy 
Even though she won't believe you, nah
Best advice I can give you, brother
Don't ever say she's acting just like her mother
Even though she does sometimes 
It's gon' be our little secret

She don't give two sips 'bout money
Likes a little coffee in her honey
Let her sleep late as she wants
Home is her favorite restaurant
Don't you dare come home if you're hammered
Better watch your mouth and your grammar
She loves babies , hates glitter
You better shave 'fore you kiss her
And if she ever misses me
Please, don't let her

Make her feel better
Say something funny, say something 'bout the weather
Tell her wherever I am, I'm good 
And if she's thinking she can love again, she should, understood?
Orchids, that's her favorite flower
Don't ever watch The Office without her
After church , she gon' talk 
Her favourite season is football
She don't give two sips 'bout money
Likes a little coffee in her honey
Let her sleep late as she wants
Home is her favorite restaurant
Don't you dare come home if you're hammered
Better watch your mouth and your grammar
She loves babies, hates glitter
You better shave 'fore you kiss her
And if she ever misses me
Please, don't let her"
Walker Hayes,Craig by Walker Hayes,"
I met Craig at a church called Redeeming Grace
Like he understood my ""I don't want to be here"" face
I felt out of place and I smelled like beer
But he just shook my hand, said ""I'm glad you're here""
He said ""we'll all be judged""
But he was never judgemental
And even though my songs don't belong in no hymnal
He'd quote me my lyrics, slap me on the back
Said ""Man you've got a gift! How you write like that?""

I know, he sounds cool right?
Not your typical kid from Sunday School, right?
I still ain't figured out church yet
But Craig, I get
Nah he can't walk on water, turn the Napa Valley red
But he just might be tight with a man that did
Yeah he's not the light of the world
But I wish that mine was bright as his
Yeah he just might be tight with a man that is

You lose a record deal, all the perks fade fast
Dealership said, ""We're going to need to get that mini-van back""
So we were down on one car
And broke as I felt
My wife and six kids with only five seat belts
I needed help but couldn't admit, I was strong
Said, ""Craig, it's all good""
But he knew it all wasn't
A ""Hey man I'm praying for you"" would've been sufficient but nah
He took roadside assistance to a
Whole other level, to sacrificial heights
Showed up at the ballpark after my son's game one night
In two cars, with his wife Barb watching from the other
Said ""What in the world are y'all doing here, brother?""
He just laughed inside that old Chrysler Town and Country van
With the keys, and a title, and a pen in his hand
Said ""Man, all you got to do is sign and it's yours""
I said ""No, no way""
But he wouldn't take ""No"" for an answer
Said ""Please do
Somebody did this for me once, just let me do this for you""
We argued about it for a little while
Then I teared up, and Craig smiled

I know, he sounds cool right?
Not your typical kid from Sunday School, right?
Nah he can't walk on water, turn the Napa Valley red
But he just might be tight with a man that did
Yeah he's not the light of the world
But I wish that mine was bright as his
Yeah he just might be tight with a man that is
Nah he's not the light of the world
But I wish that mine was bright as his
Yeah he just might be tight with a man that is
My pride was way too ashamed to be adequately grateful at the moment
But I signed the dotted line, and I drove the kids home
And when the cop pulled up beside us
At the light, they didn't have to duck
Because thanks to Craig
They were all buckled up"

Said the way you walk is suggestive
Strip mall town impressive
Girl, I hate to see you go 
But I love to watch you exit
All flames, where you cookin' that?
That bourbon kiss, where you puttin' that?
I know it's rude to stare but shoot

I don't wanna stop lookin' at you, girl
Cherry bottom boom girl
Every shade of blue jeans look mean with a body like that
Woah-woo, girl
Southern flowin' through girl
Do what you do, girl
Guys like me like girls that look like you, girl
Guys like me like girls that look like you, girl

Babe
Brown eyes like two hurricanes
Lasso me, well I hope it rains
Movin' me with the way you move

Guys like me like girls that look like you, girl
Cherry bottom boom girl
Every shade of blue jeans look mean with a body like that
Woah-woo girl
Southern flowin' through girl
Do what you do, girl

I know we meant all good intentions

So pull me closer

Why don't you come on over?
I can't just let you go

Maren Morris,My Church by Maren Morris,"
I’ve cussed on a Sunday
I’ve cheated and I’ve lied
I’ve fallen down from grace
A few too many times
But I find holy redemption
When I put this car in drive
Roll the windows down and turn up the dial

Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get an amen?
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singin' every single verse
Yeah, I guess that’s my church

When Hank brings the sermon
And Cash leads the choir
It gets my cold, cold heart burnin'
Hotter than a ring of fire
When this wonderful world gets heavy
And I need to find my escape
I just keep the wheels rolling, radio scrolling
Until my sins wash away

Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get an amen?
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singin' every single verse
Yeah, I guess that’s my church

Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get an amen?
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singin' every single verse
Yeah, I guess that’s my church
Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get an amen?
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya

And a crisp new Benjamin for when you're here then gone again
And a dollar every time I was right about you after all

Boy, I'd be rich, head to toe Prada
Benz in the driveway, yacht in the water
Vegas at the Mandarin,
high roller gambling
Me and Diddy drippin' diamonds like Marilyn

Still runs good, built to last
Moves like a hula girl on the dash
She ain't made for practicality
Yeah, I guess she's just like me

It's Saturday night, about time to go
Got my white leather jacket and a neon soul
Once I turn on the radio, I'm ready to roll, r-ready to roll

Feel like a hard-to-get starlet when I'm driving
Turning every head, hell, I ain't even trying
Got them Ray-Ban shades, pretty in pink
Call me old school, but hey
I'm a 90s baby
in my 80s Mercedes
I'm a 90s baby in my 80s Mercedes

Pop the top down like a summer dream
She's my teenage time machine
Just keeps getting sweeter with age
She's classic through any decade

The suns in the sky, glitter on the seats
You can try, but the Benz is hard to beat
So, hey, if you want you can ride with me, r-ride with me

Feel like a hard-to-get starlet when I'm driving
Turning every head, hell, I ain't even trying

Dear Hate
I saw you on the news today
Like a shock that takes my breath away
You fall like rain, cover us in drops of pain
I'm afraid that we just might drown

Dear Hate
Well, you sure are colorblind
Your kiss is the cruelest kind
You could poison any mind
Just look at mine
Don't know how this world keeps spinning 'round and 'round

You were there in the garden, like a snake in the grass
I see you in the morning staring through the looking glass
You whisper down through history and echo through these halls
But I hate to tell you, love's gonna conquer all

Dear Hate
You were smiling from that Selma bridge
In Dallas, when that bullet hit and Jackie cried
You pulled those towers from the sky
But even on our darkest nights
The world keeps spinning 'round

You were there in the garden, like a snake in the grass
I see you in the morning staring through the looking glass
You whisper down through history and echo through these halls
But I hate to tell you, love's gonna conquer all

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

Dear Love
Just when I think you've given up

You were there in the garden when I ran from your voice
I hear you every morning through the chaos and the noise
You still whisper down through history and echo through these halls
And tell me love's gonna conquer all
Gonna conquer all"

I'm the breaker of your heart
I ain't saying what you want
But baby, please, know that if

Somehow we make it alive
And both get out on the other side
Oh, this might be asking a lot
When it's all said and done, don't forget that you loved me once

It's been months; I'm still seeing signs of you
Things that you wanted me to read, shit that you wanted me to do
If I'm left in the deepest part of your mind, it's cool
Oh, it's cool

Yeah, it hurts, I agree
You're still the first part of me
I know I set you free
But baby, please, know that if

Say ""I think I love her"" when you leave that room
I'd still not take their advice when I say you're moving in

Even if I knew you'd be the one that got away
I'd still go back and get you
Even if I knew you'd be my best and worst mistake
Oh, I'd still make it with you
Over and over, again and again
Even though we break up in the end

Trying to catch a buzz
Over the thought of us

I might stay for one more round
Or I might close this place down
But don't think for a second I'm out to drown your memory
Baby, you ain't worth the whiskey

They never liked me anyway

It ain't over a broken heart

Mile by mile and
City by city she's
Gettin' over me, and man it ain't pretty, no

She's out there rolling down some old interstate
Wide open, wide open
Couldn't make her stay
Probably cranking up some new freedom song
Wide open, wide open
Won't pick up her phone

Staring goodbye in the face
Saying I love you too late
Too late

But if I could, man I would
Try and make her see
That me and Tennessee want her back
I wish it worked like that

Where she was headed now
I'd do what I had to do
To make her turn that car around

Just forgot on the shelf
No wind in the sails
Going nowhere with no one but me
I was one in a hundred billion
A burned out star in a galaxy
Just lost in the sky wondering why
Everyone else shines out but me

The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours

Wandering the city street
Another face in the crowd
Head looking down
Lost in the sound of a lonely melody
Empty pockets at a roulette
Always landing on a lost bet
Just live for the spin and hope for the win
Go all in just to lose again

About whiskey and women and getting too stoned
He got all three at the first show he played
Hometown said, ""I don't think Jesus done it that way""
Boy moves to city lives fast and goes hard
Starts chasing the devil through honky-tonk bars
Ignoring the voices in his head that say, ""I don't think Jesus done it this way""

If I was Him I'd say, ""To hell with you, ain't no helping you”
Find someone else to give Heaven to, I'm telling you
I'd shame me, I'd blame me
I'd make me pay for my mistakes
Oh, but I don't think Jesus does it that way

Boy's all alone, got no one to turn to

He said, ""I wish You would've woke me up an easier way""

Thinkin' 'bout them tan lines and I'm thinkin' damn, I'd
Love to drown in them heartbreaker blue eyes
She's somebody's problem and somebody's problem's
About to be mine
About to be mine
About to be mine
About to be mine"
Morgan Wallen,Still Goin Down by Morgan Wallen,"
The way I talk, I guess I got it from my pops
Product of some kneelin' down
In a town where the doors don't lock
And there's a million other people like me
From a scene a little more podunk than pop
I didn't choose being born in the sticks
And I'll be damned if I sound like something I ain't
For some folks, a backroad gets old
But for me, it just can't

'Cause I'm from a small town, southern drawl crowd
We're sippin' clear
, drinkin' beer on a Friday night
Every country girl got on her cutoffs
Shakin' her hips, take a trip, buddy tell me I'm a liar
Still circle up big trucks around a fire
Still kickin' up some dust behind the tires
Call it cliché, but hey, just take it from me
It's still goin' down out in the country

Somewhere now, someone's out there
Sippin' on some hundred proof
Every day, a baby's born with some
baby blues
A good ol' boy's got on his faded boots
Workin' a nine to five
I'm just another southern hell raiser
Ain't breakin' ground
Makin' sound for them drop-it-down tailgaters
But y'all, that's all I know to say
So if you think I'm full of it, ain't done it, check the resume

'Cause I'm from a small town, southern drawl crowd
We're sippin' clear, drinkin' beer on a Friday night
Every country girl got on her cutoffs
Shakin' her hips, take a trip, buddy tell me I'm a liar
Still circle up big trucks around a fire
Still kickin' up some dust behind the tires
Call it cliché, but hey, just take it from me
It's still goin' down out in the country

'Cause I'm from a small town, southern drawl crowd
We're sippin' clear, drinkin' beer on a Friday night
Every country girl got on her cutoffs
Shakin' her hips, take a trip, buddy tell me I'm a liar
Still circle up big trucks around a fire
Still kickin' up some dust behind the tires
Call it cliché, but hey, just take it from me
It's still goin' down out in the country"

It's Friday after 5, got here just in time
Went ahead and wet a line 'fore I went and lost my mind
I ain't been here long, but the bobber's in the pond
Going up down, up, down, up, down
Tonight, we're gonna raise a whole lot more than cane
'Cause there's money in the bank and tomorrow's Saturday
So if they pass that fifth of Jack this way
I turn it up, down, up, down, up, down

We just holding it down here in BFE
Still rolling around with a burnt CD
Free Bird, five minutes deep
Head bobbing up, down, up, down, up, down
We got what we got, we don't need the rest
Can turn this parking lot into a party
With an ice chest, dancing, cold beer
Man, we live it up, down, up, down
We live it up down...here

What you know about it, T-Hubb?
What up, baby?

Yeah, the girls, they hit the spot, even hotter when it's hot
If you can't buy her a yacht, but still proud of what you got
'Cause when the day's done, red neck is from the sun
Going up, down, up, down, up, down

We just holding it down here in BFE
Still rolling around with a burnt CD
Free Bird, five minutes deep
Head bobbing up, down, up, down, up, down
We got what we got, we don't need the rest
Can turn this parking lot into a party
With an ice chest, dancing, cold beer
Man, we live it up, down, up, down
We live it up, down here

Somebody pass that fifth of Camp this way
I'll turn it up, down, up, down, up, down

Morgan Wallen,Cover Me Up by Morgan Wallen,"
A heart on a run keeps a hand on a gun
Can't trust anyone
I was so sure what I needed was more
Tried to shoot out the sun
The days when we raged, we flew off the page
Such damage was done
But I made it through, 'cause somebody knew
I was meant for someone

So, girl, leave your boots by the bed, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't goin' out to chop wood
So, cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good

I put your faith to the test when I tore off your dress
In Richmond on High
I sobered up, I swore off that stuff
Forever this time
And the old lover's sing, “I thought it'd be me
Who helped him get home”
But home was a dream, one that I'd never seen
'Til you came along

So, girl, hang your dress out to dry, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til Percy Priest breaks open wide and the river runs through
And carries this house on its Stones like a piece of driftwood
So, cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good


So, girl, leave your boots by the bed, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't goin' out to chop wood

Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you

Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again

Yeah, I dropped the ball
You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind
Thinkin' 'bout all I've wasted on you

All of the these sorries I don't owe you honey
All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

Yeah, I swore this one'd be different
My heart wouldn't listen to my head and these boots on my feet
Looks like I'm learning the hard way again
That's why I've been wasted on you

All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew

Morgan Wallen,The Way I Talk by Morgan Wallen,"
It's got a touch of the town where I grew up
Something in it them California girls love
Some people like to make a little fun of
The way I talk
It gets slower after three or four cold beers
And gets louder when I'm cheerin' on the Volunteers
Folks know I'm country, when they hear
The way I talk

It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs
gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No, I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi roads
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk

Yeah it's, ""Yes sir, no ma'am, y'all come back, now""
Fightin' words if you run my last name down
I ain't ashamed, matter of fact I'm damn proud
Of the way I talk, y'all

It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder

Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi roads

Slow, like a Sunday morning service back home
And kinda sweet when I got a girl to love on
If you know me, you know

It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard

We used to chase that Chattanooga freight
Couple of kids in a Chevrolet
Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple limb
Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now what I was doing then

Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasin' that freedom, chasing' that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasin' that you and me, I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasin' you, still chasin' you

You always used to talk about LA
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Well you know I tried to track you down
I only got as far as Guitar Town
Singing about
a girl I used to know, used to know
Well you should know that
I haven't given up
I'm just on your radio

Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasin' that freedom, chasin' that feeling that got gone too soon

Out of your favorite dress?
Black mascara off a pillowcase?
Cure a one-too-many headache?

This weekend or next?
And hey, how do you get a red wine stain
Out of your favorite dress?

How does he sleep at night?
Mama, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Mama, can you die from a broken heart?

Can you ask Daddy if he's got time
To come and look at my front door?
It got slammed last night
And now it don't close right
And just promise that you won't tell him everything
And keep that pistol in the drawer
Mama, please don't say
I'm gonna laugh about this someday
You didn't see the way he drove away

How does he sleep at night?
Mama, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Mama, can you die from a broken heart?
Oh, a broken heart

Can your knees give out from prayin' so hard? 
Can you go blind from crying in the dark? 
Was it ever really real
If he don't feel like I feel?

They don't cancel other plans
Have conversations with nothin' but their eyes
They don't hear each other's names and forget to concentrate
Hits a nerve and lights you up like dynamite

Friends don't call you in the middle of the night
Couldn't even tell you why
They just felt like saying, ""Hi""
Friends don't stand around, playing with their keys
Finding reasons not to leave
Tryna hide the chemistry
Drive a little too slow 
Take the long way home 
Get a little too close 
We do but, but friends don't

They don't almost say, ""I love you""
When they're downtown somewhere, just a little drunk
They don't talk about the future and put each other in it
And get chills with every accidental touch

Friends don't call you in the middle of the night
Couldn't even tell you why
They just felt like saying, ""Hi""
Friends don't stand around, playing with their keys
Finding reasons not to leave
Trying to hide the chemistry
Drive a little too slow 
Take the long way home 
Get a little too close 
We do but, but friends don't

I keep telling myself this might be nothing 
But one look in your eyes and, God, there's something 
You can lie to me and say you don't
But I know you do, and I love you too

Friends don't call you in the middle of the night
Couldn't even tell you why
They just felt like saying, ""Hi""

This is only a test-t-t

Well, I wish I had some shoes on my two bare feet
And it's getting kinda cold in these painted on cut-off jeans

Do I really have to wear it all day? 

I hear you over there on your tailgate whistlin' 
Sayin', ""Hey, girl"" 
But you know I ain't listenin'
'Cause I got a name
And to you, it ain't ""Pretty little thing""
""Hottie"" or ""Baby""

Well, shakin' my moneymaker ain't never made me a dime
And there ain't no sugar for you in this shaker of mine

Baby blue staring in the window pane just counting drops of rain
Wondering if she’s got the guts to take it
Running down her dreams in a dirty dress, now her heart’s a mess
Praying  she will find a way to make it

So keep on climbing, though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching though the limb might break
We’ve come this far, don’t you be scared now
Cause you can learn to fly on the way down

Searching for a sign in the night, even like a lonely string of lights
That’ll burn just long enough for you to see it
The road’s been long and lonely and you feel like giving up
There’s more to this than just the breath you’re breathing

So keep on climbing, though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching though the limb might break
We’ve come this far, don’t you be scared now
Cause you can learn to fly on the way down
On the way down

You won’t forget the heavy steps it took to let it go
Close your eyes, count to ten, hold your breath
And fly

Keep on climbing, though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching though the limb might break
We’ve come this far, don’t you be scared now
Cause you can learn to fly on the way down

I'm fallin' like a Denver snowfall

Whole world in my living room
It's all you, babe
If I could paint paradise, it'd be you
It's all you, babe
Every red pin on the map I'm holding
You're everywhere I've been and everywhere I'm goin'
From Backwoods to the neon glowin'
You're everywhere I've been and everywhere I'm goin'

Ooh

About that girl and her million-dollar face

And the only one she has is on that necklace that she wears

Dierks Bentley,Drunk on a Plane by Dierks Bentley,"
I took two weeks vacation for the honeymoon
A couple tickets all inclusive down in Cancun
I couldn't get my money back so I'm in seat 7A
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I bet the fella on the aisle thought I was crazy
Cause I taped your picture to the seatback right beside me
Now I've got empty mini bottles fillin' both our trays
I'm getting drunk on a plane

Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737
rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane

We had this date marked on the calendar forever
We'd take that new wed limo airport ride together
I feel like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the cake
So hey, I'm getting drunk on a plane

Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737
Rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane

On my way home I'll bump this seat right up to first class
So I can drink that cheap champagne out of a real glass
And when we land I'll call her up and tell her kiss my ass
Cause hey, I'm drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737
Rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane

I'm getting drunk on a plane
I might be passed out
In the baggage claim
But right now
I'm drunk on a plane"
Dierks Bentley,Burning Man by Dierks Bentley (Ft. Brothers Osborne),"
Half your life you struggle
Half your life you fly
Half your life makin' trouble
Half your life makin' it right
One day I'm the exception
Most days I'm just like most
Some days I'm headed in the right direction
And some days I ain't even close

I'm a little bit steady but still a little bit rollin' stone
I'm a little bit heaven but still a little bit flesh-and-bone
Little found, little don't-know-where-I-am
I'm a little bit holy water but still a little bit burning man
Burning man

I always loved the highway
I just don't run it as fast
I still go wherever the wind blows me
But I always find my way back
I still don't get it right sometimes
I just don't get it as wrong
I still go a little bit crazy sometimes
Yeah, but now I don't stay near as long

I'm a little bit steady but still a little bit rollin' stone
I'm a little bit heaven but still a little bit flesh-and-bone
Little found, little don't-know-where-I-am
I'm a little bit holy water but still a little bit burning man
Burning man
Still just a burn, burn, burning man
Just a burning man
Woo!

Maybe I'll go to the desert
Find myself in the Joshua Tree
If we pass in the night then just hand me a light
And tell me you burned just like me
I'm a little bit steady but still a little bit rollin' stone
I'm a little bit heaven but still a little bit flesh-and-bone
Little found, little don't-know-where-I-am
I'm a little bit holy water but still a little bit burning man
Burning man
Still just a burn, burn, burning man
Just a burning man

Dierks Bentley,Hold The Light by Dierks Bentley (Ft. S. Carey),"
If it wasn't known, that our love will carry on
I will be the wind that echo's on the canyon wall
One more day with you, to walk around our neighbourhood
We will never know like it was understood

We never say goodbye
Just let me hold the light

If you've given up, I will call an end to this
I will be your rock from our perch
If you walk the ridge, you will find the marks, the scars
Kneel down by the tree, under the city stone

We never say goodbye
Just let me hold the light
We never say goodbye
I'll see you on this side
Or the other way
The desert sun kisses the sky
Baby hold the light
And keep it in your eyes
And promise that you dream with me
Beyond the walls of time
And when we laid aside
Just look up at the light

Just let me hold the light
Just let me hold the light"
Dierks Bentley,Living by Dierks Bentley,"
This mornin' I got up at 6:01
I walked out and saw the rising sun
And I drank it in like whiskey
I saw a tree I've seen a thousand times
A bird on a branch and I watched it fly away in the wind
And it hit me
It's a beautiful world sometimes I don't see so clear

Some days you just breath in
Just try to break even
Sometimes your heart's poundin' out of your chest
Sometimes it's just beatin'
Some days you just forget
What all you've been given
Some days you just get by
And some days you're just alive
Some days you're livin'
Some days you're livin'

I went back in and fired the coffee up
She walked in the kitchen like she always does
In my t-shirt and it killed me
And I kissed her like it was the first time
She laughed and looked at me like I'd lost my mind
I said ""Baby, I love you, can't live without you, I know I don't say it enough""

Some days you just breath in
Just try to break even
Sometimes your heart's poundin' out of your chest
Sometimes it's just beatin'
Some days you just forget
What all you've been given
Some days you just get by
And some days you're just alive
Some days you're livin'
Some days you're livin'

Like you never die
Blue's a little bluer up in the sky
You're high's a little high
You feel that fire you've been missing
Some days you're livingIt'a beautiful world sometimes I don't see so clear

Some days you start singin'
And you don't need a reason
Sometimes the world's just right
Your clear eyes ain't even blinkin'
Got a heart full of grateful
For all you've been given
Some days you just get by
Yeah some days you're just alive
Some days you're livin'
Some days you're livin'

Livin' like you'll never die

You're high's a little high

She don't throw any t-shirt on and walk to a bar
She don't text her friends and say, ""I gotta get laid tonight.""
She don't say, ""It's okay, I never loved him anyway.""
She don't scroll through her phone just looking for a Band-Aid

It's different for girls when their hearts get broke
They can't tape it back together with a whiskey and Coke
They don't take someone home and act like it's nothing
They can't just switch it off every time they feel something
A guy gets drunk with his friends and he might hook up
Fast forward through the pain, pushing back when the tears come on
But it's different for girls

She don't sleep all day and leave the house a wreck
She don't have the luxury to let herself go
She won't call just to curse
Found a wall she can punch
When the going gets tough, yeah, the guys they can just act tough

It's different for girls when their hearts get broke
They can't tape it back together with a whiskey and Coke
They don't take someone home and act like it's nothing
They can't just switch it off every time they feel something
A guy gets drunk with his friends and he might hook up
Fast forward through the pain, pushing back when the tears come on
But it's different for girls

It's different for girls
Nobody said it was fair
When love disappears, they can't pretend it was never there

A guy gets drunk with his friends and he might hook up
Fast forward through the pain, pushing back when the tears come on
When the going gets tough, yeah, the guys they can just act tough
So tough

Heard you called my folks

Becky was a beauty from south Alabama
Her daddy had a heart like a nine-pound hammer
Think he even did a little time in the slammer
What was I thinking?
She snuck out one night and met me by the front gate
Her daddy came out waving that twelve gauge
We tore out the drive he peppered my tailgate
What was I thinking?

Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late
Cause I was

Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where the night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking... what was I thinking

By the county line the cops were nipping on our heels
Pulled off the road and kicked it in four-wheel
Shut off the lights and tore through the corn field
What was I thinking?
Out the other side she was hollering faster
Took a dirt road and had the radio blasting
Hit the honky tonk for a little close dancing
What was I thinking?

Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late
Cause I was

Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where the night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking... what was I thinking

When a mountain of a man with a ""born to kill"" tattoo
Tried to cut in I knocked out his front tooth
We ran outside hood-sliding like Bo Duke
What was I thinking?
I finally got her home at a half past too late
Her daddy's in a lawn chair sitting on the driveway
Put it in park as he started my way
What was I thinking, oh what was I thinking, oh what was I thinking
Then she gave a come-and-get-me grin
And like a bullet we were gone again... cause I was
Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where the night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking... what was I thinking"

Well I bet my soul on a six string gamble
And I climb like hell through the brush and the bramble
Even though I had my doubts, told myself don't look down
And I turned that hill into a pile of gravel

It was only a mountain, nothing but a big ol' rock
Only a mountain, it ain't hard if you don't stop
It just took a little step, a right then a left
Then a couple million more, who's counting?
Yeah, that's only a mountain

Well you better know the bottom if you wanna be a climber
'Cause there's always another one a little bit higher
Just when I think I'm finally done I'm staring at another one
So I reach down deep and I lace 'em up tighter

It was only a mountain, nothing but a big ol' rock
Only a mountain, it ain't hard if you don't stop
It just took a little step, a right then a left
Then a couple million more, who's counting?
Yeah, that's only a mountain

Now I'm standing at the top with the sweat behind me
Yeah, you gotta look up if you ever wanna find me

It was only a mountain, nothing but a big ol' rock
Only a mountain, it ain't hard if you don't stop
It just took a little step, a right then a left

One of the best nights that I've had, no doubt
Between the bottle of wine and the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain

And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

If I never get to see the Northern Lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man
A happy man, baby, mmm

Baby, that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh, but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
You’re a saint, you’re a goddess, the cutest, the hottest, a masterpiece
It's too good to be true, nothing better than you in my wildest dreams

Dance around the fireplace

Or drive a sports car up the coast of California

Never dreamed anybody else would like them
Now they're sitting on a Walmart shelf

But everybody else said, ""Man, you're twenty-two
Whatcha trying to prove? Hey, why don't you wait?""
'Cause I've been waiting on her since the second grade, yeah
And now she got her own set of fans
She got a blue check mark by her Instagram
And I wrote a little song about holding her hand
And now everybody wanna die a happy man

We were dancin’, we were buzzin’
Takin’ shots like it was nothin’
Did the runnin’ man, you loved it
Yeah, you laughed out loud
You brushed away your blonde hair
And you kissed me out of nowhere
I can still show you the spot
Where everything went down

Oh, I told you I was gonna marry you

But they turn me away when I go to the Cotton-Eyed Joe
They say the grass is always greener, and I believe that's right
But my friends are off to Vegas, and they're leavin' me behind

What I wouldn't give to be twenty one, wild and free
Open up a cold one and drink it legally
Chase a bunch of girls, go see the world, let my wild streak run
I'll be right where I wanna be when I'm twenty one, twenty one
Woah, when I'm twenty one
Yeah, when I'm twenty one, it'll be alright
Yeah, it'll all be alright when I'm twenty one

Now I'm twenty five, and I'm drinkin' wine with my wife at home
Got a couple dogs and a couple songs on the radio
And we sit around, and we laugh about how we used to be
When all we cared about was turning sixteen"
Thomas Rhett,"Be a Light by Thomas Rhett (Ft. Chris Tomlin, Hillary Scott, Keith Urban & Reba McEntire)","
In a time full of war, be peace
In a time full of doubt, just believe
Yeah, there ain't that much difference between you and me
In a time full of war, be peace

In a world full of hate, be a light
When you do somebody wrong, make it right
Don't hide in the dark, you were born to shine
In a world full of hate, be a light

La-la-la, la, la, la, la

In a place that needs change, make a difference
In a time full of noise, just listen
'Cause life is but a breeze, better live it
In a place that needs a change, make a difference

In a world full of hate, be a light
When you do somebody wrong, make it right
Oh, don't hide in the dark, you were born to shine
In a world full of hate, be a light

La-la-la, la, la, la, la
La-la-la, la, la, la, la
La-la-la, la, la, la, la
La-la-la, la, la, la, la

In a race that you can't win, slow it down
Yeah, you only get one go around
'Cause the finish line is six feet in the ground
In a race you can't win, just slow it down

In a world full of hate, be a light 
When you do somebody wrong, make it right 
Don't hide in the dark , you were born to shine
In a world full of hate, be a light

Yeah, it's hard to live in color
When you just see black and white
In a world full of hate, be a light"
Thomas Rhett,Vacation by Thomas Rhett,"
My girl is rocking that Billabong bikini like she’s sponsored
Asking me if I can rub that Coppertone on her
Got a couple bucks, but I’m spending them like they pesos
Might be Motel Sixing but it feels like
Turks and Caicos

Put a little liquor in my coconut water 
Party all day like you at your alma mater 
Put a little liquor in my coconut water 
Ice has started melting 'cause it’s always getting hotter

Singing hey, let’s party like we on vacation
Hey, let’s party like we on vacation
I got my toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Singing hey, let’s party like we on vacation

I got my Solo Cup amplifier, playing all my jams
And my Walgreens beach chair working on my tan
Feels like it’s Jamaica and I’m sippin' on some Red Stripe
But I’m in Decatur, baby, crushing on that Busch light

Hey, let’s party like we on vacation
Hey, yeah, let’s party like we on vacation 
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Singing hey, let’s party like we on vacation

Put a little liquor in my coconut water
Party all day like you at your alma mater
Put a little liquor in my coconut water
My ice has started melting, so I’ll take another swallow

Singing hey, let’s party like we on vacation
Hey, let’s party like we on vacation
You know I got my toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Singing hey, let’s party like we on vacation

Party like I’m on vacation

Party like I’m on vacation

Party like I’m on vacation

I’m gonna rehydrate, while I dehydrate, you know

Hey, let’s party like we on vacation
Hey, yeah, let’s party like we on vacation
I got my toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Singing hey, let’s party like we on vacation


Hey, let’s party like we on vacation
Hey, party like we on vacation"
Thomas Rhett,T-Shirt by Thomas Rhett,"
Get off work and we meet down at our spot
We had a patio with a view of a parking lot
It was two for one and four for two
Had Christmas lights in the middle of June
All hung up like I was on you

I said hey, hey baby, do you wanna come over
You say, ""No way"" then you move in closer
Next thing I know you were wearing my

T-shirt, right there
Your hair messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh oh, so hot
Still got it up in my head
You were moving around in the TV light
I ain't ever seen anything like
Your dress, my floor
The way you wore my, my T-shirt
Yeah, you look good in my t-shirt, girl
Oh yeah

We were walking up the stairs
With the neighbors saying ""Keep it down""
But it's hard to unlock the door
When you're making out 
You've been saying that we've gotta quit doin' this
So why you leanin' in for one more kiss
And pretty soon you're sliding off what you've got on
And slippin' into my

T-shirt, right there
Your hair messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh oh, so hot
Still got it up in my head
You were moving around in the TV light
I ain't ever seen anything like
Your dress, my floor
The way you wore my, my t-shirt
In my t-shirt

Oh no, baby no, I can't lie
Cause you sure look good in my t-shirt
Oh no, baby no, I can't lie
You look good on my mind
I said, ""Hey, hey baby, do you wanna come over?""
You say, ""No way"" then you move in closer
Next thing I know, you were wearing my t-shirt
Mmm, you look just so dang hot in my t-shirt
I see you spinning around in my t-shirt
Right there
Your hair messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh oh, so hot

My t-shirt right there
Your hair messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh oh, so hot
Still got it up in my head
You were moving around in the TV light
I ain't ever seen anything like
Your dress, my floor
The way you wore my, my t-shirt
You look good in my t-shirt, baby
Yeah

You look good in my t-shirt
Yeah, I think you look good in my t-shirt, uh

Oh, you look so good in my t-shirt

Thomas Rhett,Playing With Fire by Thomas Rhett (Ft. Jordin Sparks),"
I know I should let it go
Take a different road
When I'm driving home
But I don't want to
Delete your number from my phone
Instead of calling
Asking if you're all alone
But I don't want to

Stay away
From your side of town
But it's too late
I'm in your drive right now

I don't know, why I don't
Put it out, baby
We kiss and the flames just get higher
But yeah, I know
When I hold onto you, baby
I'm all tangled up in barbed wire
I get burned, I don't learn
I'll be back, give it time
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy
But guess I like playing with fire

Ooh
I could find a spot to go hang out on Friday night
Where you are gonna be
But I don't want to, no
Yeah, I could let it end
Call it quits, call off all this on and off again
But I just don't want to

Yeah, that key
Is right under the mat
Come on in
Baby, let's strike that match
I don't know, why I don't
Put it out, baby
We kiss and the flames just get higher
But yeah, I know
When I hold onto you, baby
I'm all tangled up in barbed wire
I get burned, I don't learn
I'll be back, give it time
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy
But guess I like playing with fire
Playing with fire

So let's fire it up one more time 
Baby, just put your lips on mine 

I don't know, why I don't
Put it out, baby
We kiss and the flames just get higher

But yeah, I know
When I hold onto you, baby 
I'm all tangled up in barbed wire


I get burned, I don't learn
I'll be back, give it time 
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy 
But guess I like playing with fire 
Playing with fire

Playing with fire, huh"
