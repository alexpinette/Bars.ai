Olivia Rodrigo,​drivers license by Olivia Rodrigo,"
I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you

And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one, oh
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe 
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe 
I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street"
Olivia Rodrigo,​good 4 u by Olivia Rodrigo,"


Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?

And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl 

Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want 
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off 
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that? 
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you



Maybe I'm too emotional
But your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Maybe I'm too emotional
Your apathy is like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all

Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
Like a damn sociopath
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily"
Olivia Rodrigo,​deja vu by Olivia Rodrigo,"
Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin’ 'bout how small it looks on you

Watching reruns of Glee
Bein' annoying, singin’ in harmony
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm

So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she’s with you?
Do you get déjà vu?  Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?

Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
’Cause you played her ""Uptown Girl""
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse 

So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it’s all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the songs she's singing now when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? 
Do you get déjà vu?

Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do that shit, too
You're tradin' jackets like we used to do

Play her piano, but she doesn't know 
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel 
A different girl now, but there's nothing new
I know you get déjà vu
I know you get déjà vu
I know you get déjà vu"
Olivia Rodrigo,All I Want by Olivia Rodrigo,"
I found a guy, told me I was a star
He held the door, held my hand in the dark
And he's perfect on paper, but he's lying to my face
Does he think that I'm the kinda girl who needs to be saved?

And there's one more boy, he's from my past
We fell in love, but it didn't last
'Cause the second I figure it out, he pushes me away
And I won't fight for love if you won't meet me halfway
And I say that I'm through, but this song's still for you

All I want is love that lasts
Is all I want too much to ask?
Is it something wrong with me?
All I want is a good guy
Are my expectations far too high?
Try my best, but what can I say?
All I have is myself at the end of the day
But shouldn't that be enough for me?

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
And I miss the days when I was young and naive
I thought the perfect guy would come and find me
Now happy ever after, it don't come so easily

All I want is love that lasts
Is all I want too much to ask?
Is it something wrong with me? Oh, ooh
All I want is a good guy
Are my expectations far too high?
Try my best but what can I say?
All I have is myself at the end of the day
And all I want is for that to be okay"
Olivia Rodrigo,​traitor by Olivia Rodrigo,"
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Brown guilty eyes and
Little white lies, yeah
I played dumb, but I always knew
That you talked to her, maybe did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you

And ain't it funny how you ran to her
The second that we called it quits?
And ain't it funny how you said you were friends?
Now it sure as hell don't look like it

You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor

Now you bring her around just to shut me down
Show her off like she's a new trophy
And I know if you were true
There's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly

And ain't it funny? All the twisted games
All the questions you used to avoid
Ain't it funny? Remember I brought her up
And you told me I was paranoid?

You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor

God, I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with you

When she's sleepin' in the bed we made
Don't you dare forget about the way

You betrayed me
'Cause I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
You gave me your word, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still, you're still a traitor

Yeah, you're still a traitor

Ooh-ooh-ooh
God, I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with you"
Olivia Rodrigo,​happier by Olivia Rodrigo,"
We broke up a month ago
Your friends are mine, you know I know
You've moved on, found someone new
One more girl who brings out the better in you
And I thought my heart was detached
From all the sunlight of our past
But she's so sweet, she's so pretty
Does she mean you forgot about me?

Oh, I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier

And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean
Remember when I believed
You meant it when you said it first to me?
And now I'm pickin' her apart
Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart
But she's beautiful, she looks kind
She probably gives you butterflies

I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy
I wish you all the best, really
Say you love her, baby
Just not like you loved me
And think of me fondly when your hands are on her
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier

Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I hope you're happy
Just not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier"
Olivia Rodrigo,​favorite crime by Olivia Rodrigo,"
Know that I loved you so bad
I let you treat me like that
I was your willing accomplice, honey
And I watched as you fled the scene
Doe-eyed as you buried me
One heart broke, four hands bloody

The things I did
Just so I could call you mine
The things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime

You used me as an alibi
I crossed my heart as you crossed the line
And I defended you to all my friends
And now every time a siren sounds
I wondеr if you're around
'Cause you know that I'd do it all again

Oh, the things I did
Just so I could call you minе
The things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime

It's bittersweet to think about the damage that we'd do
'Cause I was goin' down, but I was doin' it with you
Yeah, everything we broke and all the trouble that we made
But I say that I hate you with a smile on my face
Oh, look what we became

Oh, the things I did
Just so I could call you mine
Oh, the things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime

Your favorite crime
Your favorite crime
'Cause, baby, you were mine"
Olivia Rodrigo,​brutal by Olivia Rodrigo,"
I want it to be, like, messy

I'm so insecure, I think
That I'll die before I drink
And I'm so caught up in the news
Of who likes me and who hates you
And I'm so tired that I might
Quit my job, start a new life
And they'd all be so disappointed
'Cause who am I if not exploited?
And I'm so sick of seventeen
Where's my fucking teenage dream?
If someone tells me one more time
""Enjoy your youth,"" I'm gonna cry
And I don't stick up for myself
I'm anxious, and nothing can help
And I wish I'd done this before
And I wish people liked me more

All I did was try my best
This the kinda thanks I get?
Unrelentlessly upset 
They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here



I feel like no one wants me
And I hate the way I'm perceived
I only have two real friends
And lately, I'm a nervous wreck
'Cause I love people I don't like
And I hate every song I write
And I'm not cool, and I'm not smart
And I can't even parallel park

All I did was try my best
This the kinda thanks I get?
Unrelentlessly upset 
They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here



Got a broken ego, broken heart

And God, I don't even know where to start"
Olivia Rodrigo,"1 step forward, 3 steps back by Olivia Rodrigo","
Called you on the phone today
Just to ask you how you were
All I did was speak normally
Somehow, I still struck a nerve
You got me fucked up in the head, boy
Never doubted myself so much
Like, am I pretty? Am I fun, boy?
I hate that I give you power over that kinda stuff

'Cause it's always one step forward and three steps back
I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
It's always one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me?
Boy, I don't understand
No, I don't understand

And maybe in some masochistic way
I kind of find it all exciting
Like, which lover will I get today?
Will you walk me to the door or send me home crying?

It's one step forward and three steps back
I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
It's always one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me?
Boy, I don't understand

No, it's back and forth, did I say something wrong?
It's back and forth, going over everything I said
It's back and forth, did I do something wrong?
It's back and forth, maybe this is all your fault instead

It's one step forward and three steps back
And I'd leave you, but the rollercoaster's all I've ever had
Yeah, it's one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me?
Boy, I don't understand
No, I don't understand"
Olivia Rodrigo,​hope ur ok by Olivia Rodrigo,"
I knew a boy once when I was small
A towhead blond with eyes of salt
He played the drum in the marching band
His parents cared more about the Bible
Than being good to their own child
He wore long sleeves 'cause of his dad
And somehow, we fell out of touch
Hope he took his bad deal and made a royal flush
Don't know if I'll see you again someday
But if you're out there, I hope that you're okay

My middle school friend grew up alone
She raised her brothers on hеr own
Her parents hated who shе loved
She couldn't wait to go to college
She was tired 'cause she was brought into a world
Where family was merely blood
Does she know how proud I am she was created
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred?
We don't talk much, but I just gotta say
I miss you and I hope that you're okay

Address the letters to the holes in my butterfly wings
Nothing's forever, nothing is as good as it seems
And when the clouds won't iron out
And the monsters creep into your house
And every door is hard to close

Well, I hope you know how proud I am you were created
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred
But, God, I hope that you're happier today
'Cause I love you
And I hope that you're okay"
Justin Bieber,Love Yourself by Justin Bieber,"

For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself"
Justin Bieber,Sorry by Justin Bieber,"

You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice, I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?

Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm not just trying to get you back on me

She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground, but I really wanna see her on the weekend
She knows she's got me dazing, 'cause she was so amazin'

Now we on top of the world  'cause that's just how we do
Used to tell me sky's the limit, now the sky's our point of view
Man, we stepping out, like whoa 
Cameras point and shoot 
Ask me, ""What's my best side?""
I stand back and point at you, you, you
The one that I argue with, feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side
It's green where you water it
So I know, we got issues baby, true, true, true
But I'd rather work on this with you
Than to go ahead and start with someone new

As long as you love me 
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

Usually, I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out

I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad

Alright, come close
Let me show you everything I know
A jungle slang
Spinning round my head and I stare
While my naked fool
Fresh out of an icky, gooey womb
A woozy youth
Dopes up on her silky, smooth perfume

Right my little pooh bear, wanna take a chance?
Wanna sip the smooth air, kick it in the sand?
I’ll say I told you so but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes

My, my simple sir, this ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy slurs
I can’t take this place, no I can’t take this place
I just wanna go where I can get some space

Truth be told
I've been there, I've done this all before
I take your gloom
I curl it up and puff it into plumes

Wanna sip the smooth air, kick it in the sand?

My, my simple sir, this ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy slurs

I just wanna go where I can get some space

Hold my hand and float back to the summer time
Tangled in the willows, now our tongues are tied
How can I believe you, how can I be nice?
Tripping round tree stumps in your summer smile
Right my little pooh bear, wanna take a chance?
Wanna sip the smooth air, kick it in the sand?

Glass Animals,The Other Side of Paradise by Glass Animals,"

When I was young and stupid my love
Left to be a rock and roll star
He told me: ""Please, don't worry""
Wise little smile that spoke so safely
He booked a one-way ticket
Out west, that's where they make it
Six kids stuck in a bedsit
To sunswept poolside riches
He met a girl who wore Versace
Pink feather coats and jumbo jewellery​
Gonna be a hoop phenomenon
He's gonna be Hakeem Olajuwon
He's got a gold Camaro
He said over the payphone
I try to keep my cool but
My life turns in slow motion

Bye-bye baby blue
I wish you could see the wicked truth
Caught up in a rush, it's killing you
Screaming at the sun you blow into
Curled up in a grip when we were us
Fingers in a fist like you might run
I settle for a ghost I never knew
Super paradise I held on to
But I settle for a ghost

Where I was from in NOLA, no one
Left to be a rock and roll star
He'd stay and treat his lady
Give everything to his new baby
I miss him, don't you blame me?
That boy went stone cold crazy
Caught up in camera lust, he's
Chasing that pappy pipe dream

I know you don't but I-
I know you don't but I still try
My thunder shook him down
My thunder came and shook him down
That girl is gone but I-
That girl is gone but I still try
I think it's over now
The bullet hit but maybe not
I feel so fucking numb
It hits my head and I feel numb
My body's looking wrong
My body's looking wrong
My body's looking wrong
Bye-bye, baby blue
I wish you could see the wicked truth
Caught up in a rush, it's killing you
Screaming at the sun you blow into
Curled up in a grip when we were us
Fingers in a fist like you might run
I settle for a ghost I never knew
Super paradise I held on to
But I settle for a ghost

With a Super Porp cola
Looking at your phone in clothes

With a cookie as a coaster

To vertical and golden

And so it hurts to say it's hopeless
And we ain't gonna make it

Why don't you light that cigarette and
Calm down now, stop and breathe a second?
Go back to the very beginning
Can't you see what was different then?
You were just popping Percocet
Maybe just four a week at best
Maybe a smoke to clear the head

Your head is so numb, that nervous breath you try to hide
Between the motions, that trembling tender little sigh
And so it goes,
a choking rose back
To be reborn, I want to hold you like you're mine

You see the sad in everything
A genius of love and loneliness and
This time, you overdid the liquor
This time, you pulled the fucking trigger
These days, you're rolling all the time
So low, so you keep getting high
Where went that cheeky friend of mine?
Where went that billion-dollar smile?

Guess life is long when soaked in sadness
On borrowed time
from Mister Madness
And so it goes,
a choking rose back
To be reborn

Looking for a better place

Woah, woah
Hello, welcome home"
Billie Eilish,​when the party's over by Billie Eilish,"
Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer 
And I'll call you when the party's over

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

But nothin' is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that"
Billie Eilish,Happier Than Ever by Billie Eilish,"
When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to 
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do 
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know

When I'm away from you 
I'm happier than ever 
Wish I could explain it better 
I wish it wasn't true, mm-mm

You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin'
leave me alone
, yeah





"
Billie Eilish,​everything i wanted by Billie Eilish,"
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly 
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried 
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care 

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?"
Billie Eilish,​bad guy by Billie Eilish,"
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

I'm the bad guy

I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

I'm a bad guy
I'm, I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad"
Billie Eilish,​idontwannabeyouanymore by Billie Eilish,"
Don't be that way
Fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say
Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Kind of mood that you wish you could sell

If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told, ""A tight dress is what makes you a whore""
If ""I love you"" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you
Anymore

Hands, hands getting cold
Losing feeling is getting old
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can't shake
We've made every mistake
Only you know the way that I break

If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told, ""A tight dress is what makes you a whore""
If ""I love you"" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?

Billie

What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

Step on the glass, staple your tongue 
Bury a friend, try to wake up 
Cannibal class, killing the son 
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…

What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now 
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now
The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful

Step on the glass, staple your tongue 
Bury a friend, try to wake up 
Cannibal class, killing the son 
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…

Try not to abuse your power

You might not wanna lose your power
But havin' it's so strange

She said you were a hero
You played the part
But you ruined her in a year
Don't act like it was hard
And you swear you didn't know 
No wonder why you didn't ask
She was sleepin' in your clothes 
But now she's got to get to class

How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad when they find out?
If you could take it all back
Would you?

Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But havin' it's so strange

I thought that I was special
You made me feel
Like it was my fault, you were the devil
Lost your appeal
Does it keep you in control? 
For you to keep her in a cage?
And you swear you didn't know 
You said you thought she was your age

How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad if it turns out
That they kill your contract?
Would you?
Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power

I just kinda wish you were gay

Is there a reason we're not through?
Is there a 12 step just for you?
Our conversation's all in blue
11 ""heys"" 
Ten fingers tearin' out my hair
Nine times you never made it there
I ate alone at 7, you were six minutes away


How am I supposed to make you feel okay
When all you do is walk the other way?
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

To spare my pride
To give your lack of interest an explanation
Don't say I'm not your type
Just say that I'm not your preferred sexual orientation
I'm so selfish
But you make me feel helpless, yeah
And I can't stand another day
Stand another day

I just wanna make you feel okay

I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gon' let them hits fly, we gon' let it go
If it ain't XO, then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talkin' 'bout a face numbin' off a bag of blow
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these R&B niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go lo mein

I'll be right there to remind you again

Faded off a double cup, I'm mixin' up the potion
All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
Platinum off a mixtape,
sippin' on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies
,
roll until my nose bleed
I'ma keep on singin' while I'm burnin' up that OG
All my niggas get it, they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck, makin' sure I'm gettin' home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk 'round with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight, eatin' all day, tryna lose weight
That good sex, we'll sweat it out
Hotel bed springs, we'll wear it out
I ain't gotta tell you
'Cause you know me

Every time you try to forget who I am

Bring your love, baby, I could bring my shame
Bring the drugs, baby, I could bring my pain
Oh, I got my heart right here
Oh, I got my scars right here
Bring the cups, baby, I could bring the drank
Bring your body, baby, I could bring you fame
And that's my motherfucking words too, ayy
So let me motherfucking love you
Listen, ma, I'll give you all I got
Get me off of this , I need confidence   in myself 
Listen, ma, I'll give you all of me

Ah, whatever goes around
Eventually comes back to you
So you gotta be careful, baby
And look both ways
Before you cross my mind

Did you ever wonder, yeah, do you ever wonder?
What he might be going through on his own, and
The demons that he's facing alone

I hate that sometimes I can't go home
And it just ain't the same on the phone, no
But everybody's gotta go on, don't they?
Yes, we do, baby

So if you need a hero 
Just look in the mirror 
No one's gonna save you now
So you better save yourself
And everybody's hurting
Everybody's going through it
But you just can't give up now
'Cause you gotta save yourself
Yeah, gotta hang on, baby

The sun'll come out, nothing good ever comes easy
I know times are rough but winners don't quit
So don't you give up, the sun'll come out
But we've been struggling endlessly
Someday we'll find the love
'Cause after the storm's when the flowers bloom

Kali, what you mean? I take it offensive
'Cause I'm the hottest flower boy
That popped up on the scene
Feeling better, better than ever
'Cause your umbrella, -brella 
Sun is beaming on me like headlights beaming on Bambi
Now let's pretend the street is the room
And you are a Camry, 'cause you drive me candy
The Tito to my Randy, now let's produce some thrillers
My chocolate wit' yo' vanilla, uh
The sun'll come out
Nothing good ever comes easy
I know times are rough
But winners don't quit
So don't you give up
The sun'll come out
But we've been struggling endless days
Someday we'll find the love
'Cause after the storm

I know it's hard
But did you even really try?
Maybe you could understand
When all you had to do was ask
And just open your mind
When everything is passing by
And all you had to do was try
Yeah, all you had to do was try

Try, try, try, try, try
And all you had to do was try
Try, try, try, try"

All o' sudden you're not into me

And I know you never asked me
I just gotta put it out there
I don't put myself out there
Usually, I stay tucked away

And I let you in after all the persuasion
Mind games, manipulations

That's why I'd rather be a loner

No, boy, I don't want you later

Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día

If you want it, you could take a private plane
A kilómetros estamos conectando
Y me prendes aunque no me estés tocando
You know I got a lot to say
All these voices in the background of my brain
Y me dicen todo lo que estás pensando
Me imagino lo que ya estás maquinando

I can read your mind, I can read your mind
What you wanna do?
It's written all over your face, times two

Listen while you talk when you're fast asleep
You stay on the phone just to hear me breathe

Time I spent with you deceivin' me
I don't care if you believe in me
I still wonder why you're leavin' me
I don't care if you believe me
I still wonder why you tease me

And if I'm takin' this the wrong way
I hope you know that you can tell me whatever you're thinkin'

Woah, uh
Oh, oh-oh, oh 

I try to be everything that I can

I try to be everything that I can
But sometimes, I come out as bein' nothin'
I pray to God that He make me a better man 
Maybe one day, I’ma stand for somethin'
I'm thankin' God that He made you part of the plan
I guess I ain't go through all that Hell for nothin'
I'm always fuckin' up and wreckin’ shit
It seems like I perfected it
I offer you my love
I hope you take it like some medicine
Tell me ain’t nobody better than me
I think that there's better than me
Hope you see the better in me
Always end up betterin’ me

This type of love don't always come and go

We take drugs, then you hold me close
Then I tell you how you make me whole
Sometimes, I feel you like bein' alone
Then you tell me that I shoulda stayed in the room
Guess I got it all wrong all along, my fault
My mistakes probably wipe all the rights I've done
Sayin' goodbye to bygones, those are bygones
Head up, baby, stay strong, we gon' live long

Mello made it right
I got pain in my heart, I told you a hundred times
Yeah

I got pain in my heart, I told you a hundred times
But it's money, money, money, money, money on my mind
Put a beam on the glizzy, don't get caught between the lines
Last nigga we got busy on got hit between the eyes
Roll my problems in a Backwood and put it in the sky
Got your mans in this Backwood, put it in the sky
I was taught to love my brothers and to hate the other side
Hate the other side, hate the other side

Bougie off the ecstasy, I might act rude, uh
I lost gang members, I can't act cool, uh
I got gang scriptures in my tattoos
I was runnin' from the police in my trap shoes
Posted, tryna flip a hundred, I couldn't buy food
Come from nothin', but I blossomed to a tycoon
Betrayal scars, can't stop thinkin' 'bout them stab wounds
We might not catch him today but he gon' die soon
I'm from Chicago, she said she like my accent
I'm from Chicago where Glocks what we react with
Standin' tall, make him tumble when that MAC spit
Bitch, I'm a gangster, I just took off on some rap shit 

I got pain in my heart, I told you a hundred times
But it's money, money, money, money, money on my mind
Put a beam on the glizzy, don't get caught between the lines
Last nigga we got busy on got hit between the eyes

Got your mans in this Backwood, put it in the sky
I was taught to love my brothers and to hate the other side
Hate the other side , hate the other side

Hate the other side , hate the other side
Could give a fuck about a bitch, got too much money on my mind
Shit, I heard they was lookin' for me, I'm not hard to find
Everybody that I'm with got nothin' to lose, bitch, they gon' ride

Saw my uncle in the grave, that brought tears to my eyes
But I ain't gon lie, I done been through this shit too many times
My heart's still tryna recover from pain all my life
I really been to hell and back a couple hundred times
Couple hundred times, read between the lines
I'm still tryin', I'm still tryin' to get by 
I still got memories that lay deep inside
Creepin' up on my mind
It's fuckin' up my life
I got pain in my heart, I told you a hundred times
But it's money, money, money, money, money on my mind
Put a beam on the glizzy, don't get caught between the lines

Marshmello,Danger by Migos & Marshmello,"
Tryna get demons up outta me 
Turn to a beast, eat your arteries 
Deceasing opponents so properly 
Unleashing the dark side what got to me 
We come to take this shit over 
Foot on the gas, hear the motor 
Switchin' my thoughts, I'm bipolar 
I stare in the eyes of a cobra 
Say you want smoke, come get it 
You wanna play dumb, I'm wit' it 
I'm about to take over the city 
I came with my committee, gang with it 
Came for the bag and the profit 
Lookin' for the wave when we got it 
Nigga, you ain't scare nobody 
Bop-bop, that's a whole body 

Cold case, cold-cold case
On the dark side, if you keep cold, it's a cold case
Cold-cold case, cold-cold case
In my right mind, I can ride right 'til I road rage
Cold-cold case, cold case
Skeleton on my left wrist, in that soul place
Cold-cold case, cold-cold case
On my knees, thanking God that he got me through the pain

Danger, danger
I don't fit in, I'm a stranger
Believer, believer
I can take out all the evil
Empowerment to all my people
I can prove to you I'm a leader
Run through the money, no Visa
Forgive me 'cause my life illegal

Searchin' for the bag and the prize 
On a mission lookin' for them bad guys
Can't run no play over my head, I'm real wise
Look at his eyes, wide, think he traumatized
Take me as a joke, I'ma hang 'em on the rope 
'Cause where I'm from, we don't play like that on
Nawfside

Better not freeze 'cause we know you're gon' choke 
Talk behind my back but your shots backfired 
I know you tried but you never could survive
I see the fear that's in your eyes 
Run like Forrest, they tryna hide
They criticize in disguise 
They know I can only tell the truth 
They know all you do is tell lies 
I'm about to take over the city, tell me you just with it
'Cause I know my squad gon' ride 
Cold case, cold-cold case
On the dark side, if you keep cold, it's a cold case
Cold-cold case, cold-cold case
In my right mind, I can ride right 'til I road rage
Cold-cold case, cold case
Skeleton on my left wrist, in that soul place
Cold-cold case, cold-cold case
On my knees, thanking God that he got me through the pain

You wanna play dumb, I'm with it

Way too much of my energy

You take my cares away

Find my way up into the clouds
Tune it out, they can be so loud

Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
Your bullets? Your bullets?

Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here

Just stop your crying, have the time of your life
Breaking through the atmosphere
And things are pretty good from here
Remember everything will be alright
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here

We never learn, we been here before

Seems you cannot be replaced

Sign first, middle, last on the wisdom tooth
Niggas wishin' that the pussy was a kissin' booth

And when we French, refresh, gimme two
When I bite that lip, come get me too

Fantasy and whip appeal is all I can give you

Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so 

Every time I take a break, the game be so boring
Pretty like Naomi, Cassie, plus Lauren
Spittin' like Weezy, Foxy, plus Lauryn
Ball like the Rams, see, now that's Gordon
They don't understand the bag talk, I'm foreign
When they think they top the queen, they start fallin'
Word to my ass-shots, I'm so cheeky
Got 'em tryna palm my ass like young Keke
Yes, I'm ghetto, word to Geppetto
Plus I'm little, where's my stiletto?
Tell Mike Jordan send me my Retros
Used to be bi, but now I'm just hetero
Ain't talkin' medicine, but I made him more a fiend
Ever since I put the cookie on quarantine
He know this thing A1 like a felony
All he gotta do is say the word like a spelling bee

Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so 

Let me check my chest, my breath right quick 
He ain't ever seen it in a dress like this 
He ain't ever even been impressed like this
Prolly why I got him quiet on the set like zip
Like it, love it, need it, bad
Take it, own it, steal it, fast
Boy, stop playing, grab my ass
Why you actin' like you shy? 
Shut it, save it, keep it pushin'
Why you beating 'round the bush?
Knowin' you want all this woman
Never knock it 'til you try 
All of them bitches hating I have you with me
All of my niggas sayin' you mad committed
Realer than anybody you had, and pretty
All of the body-ody, the ass and titties

Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
Yeah, you know it
Yeah, you know it
Yeah, you know it
Yeah, you know it

You coulda said so
Boy, you shoulda said so
Say so, say so
I got dressed just to sit in the house
People with the least always doin' the most
I'm countin' money while he suckin' my toes
Real nasty with them balls, all net, yeah, I'm gross
Why you talkin' 'bout who body fake?
With all them fillers in your face, you just full of hate
That real ass ain't keep your nigga home
Now you lookin' silly, that's word to silicone"

The beach is a good place to pick up girls because you can really see what you're getting
Most beaches are- of chicks
And they’re-and they're-and they're-and they’re-and they're-and they're-and they're-and they're
Hm, mm, mm

I've been moving in backward directions
During astral projections
I plaster my ass on the wall for attention
I need faster connections
Past is regret, I'd flash from the gemses
If I didn't care what my friends did
Friends that pretend, wanna end when you get bit
Get slick, get quick, wanna spend shit
Ends with a sniff or a huff or injection
I can’t handle rejection
,
stand my reflection
Damn, no one gets it
Should I be kind and remind that I’m weak?
So I fall more behind every week
I'm the ’shine once guys take a peek
I cry from my eyes to my feet
Stairs to the streets, to the gutters, to the sea
When I mutter in my sleep
I say, ""Mother never weep""
My brother finds blood
I say, ""Shut up 'fore she sees""
Another motherfucking treat
Won-wonder will she weep, won-wonder where she be
Thunder on my teeth
Spittin' natural disasters
God told me, ""Cat, don't mess with the past tense""
You’re testing the masters
So guess what the fact is
My ex is a bachelor
Next, gonna get big checks from the sets
Next, from the dancers
Next, from the models
This Hennessy is cursed
Someone hexed all the bottles
Someone hexed all the bottles
I swear on my life, I always try
But in my eyes, I can fly
Sigh

Be-be-better luck next time
Better luck next time

Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
I'm afraid of all I am

Silence ringing inside my head
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home

We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game

Giving us up didn't take a lot

Just close your eyes, close your eyes
Feels so good when I have you in my arms
Really think it's right where you belong

Don't pull back if you start to fall
Let ourselves get a little lost

If this is home
Then what do I call where I came from?
I haven't seen the coast for so long
They got 'em here, but they're not the same
I'll never know
Know if I left too soon and too young
The people there who taught me so much
Did they get old?
Would they know this face?

Oh, it would've been selfless if I stayed
Oh, but I'm living here selfish in LA

There are no stars in The Hills
But still I find myself reaching for them
Fighting for thеm
Dying for them
Still, there arе no stars in The Hills

Miss dad and mom
And laughing with my little brothers
They're the ones who keep me humble
I'm not there to see them growing up

Oh, it would have been selfless if I stayed
Oh, but I'm living here selfish in LA

There are no stars in The Hills
But still I find myself reaching for them
Fighting for them
Dying for them

She wore white that day
Her hair up, the most beautiful she ever felt
She gave her heart that day
You promised it'd be safe in your arms
And you'll never let it go to waste
With everyone she loved by the water
She wore white that day
She was your everything
First sight from the moment on the summer night
But she couldn't stay
So you planned out all your life in your lettеrs
Up until that winter's day
You took a plane so you would be togеther
She was your everything

Now tell her what's changed between good and goodbye
Why you tryin' everything to walk out of her life?
If you leave now, don't leave her with the blame
You know she's gonna take it anyway
Tell her what's changed

Can you find yourself?
Think twice about everything before you go
Can you remind yourself?
If you break it, it always will be broken
Can you see the consequences
Of leaving all these words unspoken?
Can you find yourself?

Now tell her what's changed between good and goodbye
Why you tryin' everything to walk out of her life?
If you leave now, don't leave her with the blame
You know she's gonna take it anyway
Tell her what's changed

And all you think about
The family you can live without
How can you just turn and walk away?
Tell her what's changed between good and goodbye
Why you tryin' everything to walk out of her life?
If you leave now, don't leave her with the blame

Somewhere in that long night

Some people drive to be alone, but that's not where I am

Taylor Swift,All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version) [From the Vault] by Taylor Swift,"
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

Well,
maybe we got lost in translation
, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all

They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it  all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there 
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there 
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there 
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it 
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it"

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'
'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite"

To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall

I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before

Ooh, ooh, ooh

I can see you starin', honey
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancin' on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury

I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
I'm not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
You were my crown, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leaving out the side door

So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out 
You never gave a warning sign 
All this time
I never learned to read your mind 
I couldn't turn things around 
'Cause you never gave a warning sign 
So many signs, so many signs
You didn't even see the signs
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leavin' out the side door

So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out 
You never gave a warning sign 
All this time
I never learned to read your mind 
I couldn't turn things around 
'Cause you never gave a warning sign 
You never gave a warning sign 
 I never learned to read your mind
 I couldn't turn things around 
'Cause you never gave a warning sign 
You never gave a warning sign

Taylor Swift,​the 1 by Taylor Swift,"
I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
Been saying ""yes"" instead of ""no""
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinée
You know the greatest films of all time were never made

I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now

But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one


I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now

I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day waking up alone

But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?
We were something, don't you think so?
Rosé flowing with your chosen family
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me
In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
"
Taylor Swift,Lover by Taylor Swift,"
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home 
You're my, my, my, my lover

Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home 
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover"
Taylor Swift,All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version) [Live Acoustic] by Taylor Swift,"
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You told me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""fuck the patriarchy""
Key chain on the ground, we were always skipping town
And I was thinking on the drive down, any time now
He's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

Well, maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all

They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new Hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weeping in a party bathroom
Some actress asking me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sipping coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

And I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you, too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it , all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well

I love you guys so much"
Taylor Swift,Look What You Made Me Do by Taylor Swift,"
I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you 

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast 
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams

""Why? Oh, 'cause she's dead!""

Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe

You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him

You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said ""James, get in, let's drive""
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long
Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again

The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party

Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

Standing in your cardigan
Kissin' in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss you"
Taylor Swift,​august by Taylor Swift,"
Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of ""Are you sure?""
""Never have I ever before""

But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you

But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

Back when we were still changin' for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, ""Meet me behind the mall""
So much for summer love and saying ""us""
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, no

But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine
'Cause you were never mine
Never mine
But do you remember?
Remember when I pulled up and said ""Get in the car""
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
""Meet me behind the mall""




Remember when I pulled up and said ""Get in the car""
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all 
For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah

You like the bad ones, too

You so dope, don't overdose

We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin’ a boat 
I got a reputation, girl that don't precede me 
I'm one call away whenever you need me

I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like 
You love it, I love it too 'cause you my type 
You hold me down and I protect you with my life

I wanna be your first string 
I wanna be your A-Team 
I wanna be your end game, end game
Knew her when I was young, reconnected when we were little bit older
Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me, in rumors, I'm knee-deep
The truth is, it’s easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we'd argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July
I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it

I don't wanna touch you 
Just another ex-love 
I don't wanna miss you 
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you 
Drinking on a beach with 
I know what they all say

You like the bad ones, too

I hit you like bang
We tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me
They told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go
Your handprints on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor
It's like your body is gold
You've been callin' my bluff on all my usual tricks

Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though

The AP goin' psycho, my Rollie goin' brazy
I'm hittin' lil' mama, she wanna have my babies
It's fifty on the pinky, chain so stanky
You should see the whip, promise I can take yo' bitch
Dolla ridin' in an old school Chevy, it's a drop top
Boolin' with a thot-thot, she gon' give me top-top
Just one switch, I can make the ass drop 
Ayy, take you to the smoke shop
We gon' get high, ayy, we gon' hit Rodeo
Dial up Valentino, we gon' hit Pico
Take you where I'm from, take you to the slums
This ain't happen overnight, no, these diamonds real bright
Saint Laurent jeans, still in my Vans though
All VVS', put you in a necklace
Girl, you look beautiful tonight
Stars on the roof, they matching with the jewelry
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload

She told me that I'm not enough

Surprised when you caught me off guard

You was my shorty, I thought

Never caught a feelin' this hard
Harder than the liquor I pour
Tell me you don't want me no more
But I can't let go, everybody told me so
Feelin' like I sold my soul
Devil in the form of a whore
Devil in the form of a whore
You said it, no, you said it
No, you said that shit, we'd be together, oh

Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core

Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

Ice keep pourin' and the drink keep flowin'
Try to brush it off, but it keep on goin'
Covered in scars and I can't help showin'
Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep rollin'
Ice keep droppin' and the drink keep flowin'
Try to brush it off, but it keep on goin'
All these scars, can't help from showin'
Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep blowin', yeah

You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget

He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life, it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it's gonna take 
Another foreign or a bigger chain 
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on looking back on better days

And tell me what you think

So beautiful, please, woman

Don't break your back for me
I'll put you out of your misery

Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
I'm here, but don't count on me to—

Stay a little longer if you convince me
And tell me all the things that you have against me
Every time we make up, the truth is fadin'
Everybody's blind when the view's amazin'
Damn, who are we right now?
Can we have a little conversation?
Figure it out with no intoxication
We carry on, what is our motivation?
We're never wrong, how the hell we gonna make it?
Maybe we're used to this
Tell me, what are we to do?
It's like we only play to lose
Chasin' pain with an excuse
I love that shit and so do you

But don't break your back for me

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards

Dua Lipa,Scared to Be Lonely by Martin Garrix & Dua Lipa,"
It was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart
Closer the better

Now we're picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more

Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?


Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels

All the messed up fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
It's like we keep coming back for more

Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?

Scared to be lonely, ooh, ooh, ooh

Even when we know it's wrong
And somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how can we keep holding on?
Holding on tonight 'cause we're scared to be lonely
Even when we know it's wrong
And somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how can we keep holding on?
Holding on tonight 'cause we're scared to be lonely
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?

Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?
Though it took some time to survive you

So moved on, it's scary

Dua Lipa,Break My Heart by Dua Lipa,"
I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?

Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

I wonder, when you go, if I stay on your mind
Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time
Yeah, you got me

Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home 
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

Ooh, break my heart
Ooh, break my heart
Ooh
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home 
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no , I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?"

Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on

Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

Are we tone deaf?
Keep sweeping it under the mat
Thought we could do better than that
I hope we can
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on

Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

It is my desire
Break down the walls to connect, inspire
Ay, up in your high place, liars
Time is ticking for the empire
The truth they feed is feeble
As so many times before
They greed over the people
They stumbling and fumbling
And we're about to riot
They woke up, they woke up the lions

Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm

Turn it up

It goes on, and on, and on
It goes on, and on, and on
It goes on, and on, and on

If she do right, told her get whatever you like

Offset
I grab her legs and now divide, aight
Make her do a donut when she ride, aight
Looking at the eyes of a dime, make you blind
In her spine and my diamonds change the climate

Sweet tooth, no tooth fairy
Whipped cream, no dairy
Got her hot light on, screaming, ""I'm ready""
But no horses, no carriage

Katy Perry,Firework by Katy Perry,"
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""awe, awe, awe,""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go,
""awe, awe, awe""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""awe, awe, awe""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go,
""awe, awe, awe""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""awe, awe, awe,""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go,
""awe, awe, awe""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon

I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything

You held me down, but I got up 
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up 
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now

I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You’re gonna hear me roar

Now I’m floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee,
I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero

You held me down, but I got up 
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up 
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar

Dancing through the fire

Katy Perry,Never Really Over by Katy Perry,"
I'm losing my self-control
Yeah, you’re starting to trickle back in
But I don't wanna fall down the rabbit hole
Cross my heart, I won't do it again

I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, ""Draw the line""
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
And I think of you

Two years and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it’s never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it’s over doesn’t mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you’ll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

I guess I could try hypnotherapy
I gotta rewire this brain
'Cause I can't even go on the internet
Without even checking your name

I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, ""Draw the line""
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
I think of you

Two years and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it’s never really over

And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time was the last
But I guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line right through you and I
Can't keep going back
I guess it's never really over, yeah

Two years and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

Katy Perry,The One That Got Away by Katy Perry,"
Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talked about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

But in another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

The one
The one
The one
The one that got away

All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, whoa
'Cause now I pay the price

In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
The one 
The one 
The one 
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away

Welcome to the danger zone
Step into the fantasy
You are not invited to the other side of sanity
They callin' me an alien, a big headed astronaut
Maybe it's because ya boy Yeezy get ass a lot

You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil?
Could you be an angel?
Your touch, magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing
They say be afraid
You're not like the others
Futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you

You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin'
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers
Stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic

You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin'
Fill me with your poison

Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

This is transcendental
On another level
Boy, you're my lucky star
I wanna walk on your wavelength
And be there when you vibrate
For you, I'll risk it all, all

I know a bar out in Mars
Where they driving spaceships instead of cars
Cop a Prada space suit up out the stars
Getting stupid high straight up out the jars
Pockets on Shrek,
rockets on deck
Tell me what's next? Alien sex
I'ma disrobe you
Then I'ma probe you
See I abducted you
So I tell you what to do
I tell you what to do, what to do, what to do
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin'
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction

I won't just survive
Oh, you will see me thrive
Can't write my story
I'm beyond the archetype
I won't just conform
No matter how you shake my core
’Cause my roots, they run deep, oh


Don't doubt it, don't doubt it

I know it, I know it

I'll fight it, I'll fight it
I will transform

When, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, ”You're out of time.”
But still, I rise
This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in; think again
Don't be surprised, I will still rise

I must stay conscious
Through the madness and chaos
So I call on my angels
They say...


Don't doubt it, don't doubt it

You know it, you know it
And you will not negotiate
Just fight it, just fight it
And be transformed

’Cause when, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, “You're out of time.”
But still, I rise
This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in; think again
Don't be surprised, I will still rise

I still remember, third of December, me in your sweater
You said it looked better on me than it did you
Only if you knew, how much I liked you
But I watch your eyes as she

Walks by
What a sight for sore eyes
, brighter than a blue sky
She's got you mesmerized while I die

Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester
But you like her better


Watch as she stands with her, holding your hand
Put your arm 'round her shoulder, now I'm getting colder
But how could I hate her? She's such an angel
But then again, kinda wish she were dead as she

Walks by
What a sight for sore eyes, brighter than a blue sky
She's got you mesmerized while I die

Why would you ever kiss me?

You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester

Let me tell you a story about a boy and a girl
It's kinda short, kinda boring, but the end is a whirl
They were just sixteen when the people were mean
So they didn't love themselves, and now they're gone
Headstones on a lawn

And when I was younger, I knew a boy and a boy
Best friends with each other, but always wished they were more
'Cause they loved one another, but never discovered
'Cause they were too afraid of what they'd say
Moved to different states

Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
It ain't funny, it ain't pretty, it ain't sweet
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
But I think that it could work for you and me
Just wait and see
It's not the end of the story

Now it's on to the sequel about me and my friend
Both our parents were evil
, so we both made a bet
If we worked and we saved, we could both run away
And we'd have a better life, and I was right
I wonder if she's alright

Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
It ain't funny, it ain't pretty, it ain't sweet
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
But I think that it could work for you and me
Just wait and see

And I hope that they all get their happy end

Don't take a hit, don't kiss my lips
And please don't drink more beer

I'ma crawl out the window now
'Cause I don't like anyone around
Kinda hope you're followin' me out
But this is definitely not my crowd

Nineteen, but you act twenty-five now
Knees weak, but you talk pretty fly, wow
Ripped jeans and a cup that you just downed
Take me where the music ain't too loud
Trade drinks, but you don't even know her
Save me 'til the party is over
Kiss me in the seat of your Rover
Real sweet, but I wish you were sober


I wish you were sober

I wish you were sober

Trip down the road, walking you home
You kiss me at your door
Pulling me close, beg me stay over
But I'm over this roller coaster

I'ma crawl out the window now
Getting good at saying, ""Gotta bounce""
Honestly, you always let me down
And I know we're not just hanging out
Nineteen, but you act twenty-five now
Knees weak, but you talk pretty fly, wow
Ripped jeans and a cup that you just downed
Take me where the music ain't too loud
Trade drinks, but you don't even know her
Save me 'til the party is over
Kiss me in the seat of your Rover
Real sweet, but I wish you were sober


I wish you were sober

I wish you were sober

I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish you were sober
I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish
Oh, I wish you were sober

Nineteen, but you act twenty-five now
Knees weak, but you talk pretty fly, wow
Ripped jeans and a cup that you just downed
Take me where the music ain't too loud
Trade drinks, but you don't even know her

Real sweet, but I wish you were sober"
Conan Gray,Idle Town by Conan Gray,"
This town will never change
People come and go, it's all the same
Speed the roads on our doubting days
To any place that's far away
I never learned anybody's name
We all vowed that we wouldn't stay
Kissing signs on the interstate
All we do for now is sit and wait

In our idle town, in our idle town

Yeah, we invent our own little games 
When the lights out at the stadium, hey 
Making life a spinning arcade 
And curfew's at midnight, we watch the sunrise
We watch the sunrise
We watch the sun

Springtime when the air is thin
We're getting antsy and they're noticing
While everybody's off partying
We're watching stars over ice-cream
And now we're kicking up to seventh gear
And we're breathing in the atmosphere
And I don't even need a sip of beer
Yeah I can feel it all

In our idle town, in our idle town

Yeah, we invent our own little games 
When the lights out at the stadium, hey 
Making life a spinning arcade 
And curfew's at midnight, we watch the sunrise
We watch the sunrise
We watch the sun

And they watched the sunrise
Blinking out of red eyes, and sore minds
The airplanes keep flying by, and they cry
'Cause they've never even touched the sky
No, they'll never even touch the sky
Yeah we invent our own little games 
And everybody's trying to escape 
Killing time at the yellow café

And curfew's at midnight 

Yeah I think that we'll all be okay 
The idle town will stay as it stays 
And everyone I love's in this place 
So curfew's at midnight
We watch the sunrise"
Conan Gray,Astronomy by Conan Gray,"
We drive through the woods,
rich neighborhoods to watch
We joked as we looked that they were too good for us
'Cause socially speaking, we were the same
With runaway fathers and mothers who drank
A tale old as time, young love don't last for life
And now I know, now I know
It's time to go, it's time to go

We've traveled the seas,
we've ridden the stars
We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars
As much as it seems like you own my heart
It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart

 We're two worlds apart
 We're two worlds apart

From far away, I wish I'd stayed with you
But here, face to face, a stranger that I once knew
I thought if I wandered, I'd fall back in love
You said distance brings fondness, but guess not with us
The only mistake that we didn't make was run


We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars
We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars
As much as it seems like you own my heart
It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart

 We're two worlds apart

Stop tryna keep us alive
You're pointing at stars in the sky
That already died
Stop tryna keep us alive
You can't force the stars to align
When they've already died
Oh, we've died, ooh
Oh, we've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars
We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars
As much as it seems like you own my heart
It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart"
Conan Gray,Lookalike by Conan Gray,"
Let's go back to the summer night
When we met eyes, it’s like a movie line
Kissin' underneath the city lights
But now you're laying in another guy’s arms
'Cause I'm all gone

But when you look in his eyes
Do you think of mine?
And when you look at that smile
Do I cross your mind?
I know in your head
You see me instead
'Cause he looks a lot like I did back then
Baby don't lie
He's just a lookalike

Can't redo what's already done
Can’t compete ’cause I've already won
Sayin’ this time, ""It's really love""
But honey, you're not fooling anyone
Don't you know we’re done?

But when you look in his eyes
Do you think of mine?
And when you look at that smile
Do I cross your mind?
I know in your head
You see me instead
'Cause he looks a lot like I did back then
Baby don't lie
He's just a lookalike

And I'll admit that I sometimes, maybe, might
Think about you at night, well, almost every night
No matter how I try to hide
And erase you from my mind
I'm dying
To find a lookalike
'Cause when you look in his eyes
Hope you think of mine
And when you look at that smile
Hope I cross your mind
I hope in your head
You see me instead
'Cause you've been in mine every day since then
Maybe it's time to find a lookalike

No, I can't lie
I need a lookalike"

One day, when I came home at lunchtime
I heard a funny noise
Went out to the backyard to find out
If it was one of those rowdy boys
Stood there with my neighbor called Peter
And a Flux Capacitor

He told me he built a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen, yeah

He said, ""I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doin' fine, doin' fine""

He took me to the future in the flux thing
And I saw everything
Boy bands, and another one, and another one
And another one
Girls there with round hair like Star Wars
Float above the floor

We drove around in a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen, yeah, woo

He said, ""I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doin' fine, doin' fine""

I took a ship to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album
It had outsold Kelly Clarkson
I took a ship to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album

Hopeless, head over heels in the moment
I never thought that I'd get hit by this lovebug again

I can't get your smile out of my mind

I think about your eyes all the time
You're beautiful, but you don't even try

Modesty is just so hard to find

Over the edge, I'm just breathless

Hopeless, head over heels in the moment

Suddenly I forgot how to speak
Hopeless, breathless, baby, can't you see?

Days lifted in a haze, we weren't just a phase
We weren't just pretend

But I like to get my love caught in a slamming door
How about some information
Please

Straight up now, tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever?

Or am I caught in a hit and run?
Straight up now, tell me
Is it gonna be you and me together?

Or are you just having fun?
Do, do you love me
Do you love me?
Do, do you love me
Do you love me?
Do, do you love me

Straight up now, tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever?

Or am I caught in a hit and run?
Straight up now, tell me
Is it gonna be you and me together?

Or are you just having fun?
Straight up now, tell me

What I like, what, what I like it, like it
When I like, when, when I like to do it
How I like, just how I like it, like it

Got a gang of bad bitches, we're the one-up
In the hot tub, trippin' like we're stardust
Now she baked and gettin' naked like a strip club
Gonna tip her 'cause it's all love
We so pretty, poppin' kitty like a long gun
Mamacita said you're here, bet you want one
It's the morning and we on it but we're not done
Party happened

We've been stoked, turn it out, it's a long night
It's what I like

'Cause it's what I like, what, what I like it, like it
When I like, when, when I like to do it
How I like, just how I like it, like it 
'Cause it's what I like, what, what I like it, like it
When I like, when, when I like to do it
How I like, just how I like it, like it 

We so twisted, had it lifted, rollin' paper
We so bad, it's why you mad, I don't see haters
Vision blurry and I'm slurrin' up my words
Party favors

We've been stoked, turn it out, it's a long night
It's what I like

'Cause it's what I like, what, what I like it, like it
When I like, when, when I like to do it
How I like, just how I like it, like it 
'Cause it's what I like, what, what I like it, like it
When I like, when, when I like to do it
How I like, just how I like it, like it 
We go, drink, drink 'til the last drop
We go, sing, sing to your favorite songs
We get faded til' the sun's up
And we don't gotta say goodnight

'Cause it's what I like, what, what I like it, like it
When I like, when, when I like to do it
How I like, just how I like it, like it 
'Cause it's what I like, what, what I like it, like it

Gia Woods,HUNGRY by Gia Woods,"
I'm not shy
I'm just sussin' out the room on my own time
Not the kind of girl to put it all online
Posin' for the mirror in the bathroom of some party
It's for my eyes only

I'm in the driver seat, seat
Out here doing what I please, please 
I'm the only one I need, need
And, no, I didn't ask you what you think

If you got bad taste, don't go shoving it down my throat
I'm not hungry, bitch, leave me alone
I get a stomach ache when I see your name on my phone
I'm not hungry, bitch, leave me alone

Catch 22
They tell you, ""Be yourself,"" and then they change the rules
Yeah, all my exes did that and some white men too
But right now I don't care
I'm thinkin' red wine 'til breakfast
So I calm down and don't start shit

I'm in the driver seat, seat
Out here doing what I please, please
I'm the only one I need, need
And, no, I didn't ask you what you think

If you got bad taste, don't go shoving it down my throat
I'm not hungry, bitch, leave me alone
I get a stomach ache when I see your name on my phone, ah
I'm not hungry, bitch, leave me alone

Gia Woods,One Big Party by Gia Woods,"
You and me were one big party
Wasn’t it the best of times?
Strangers when the whole thing started
Thought that we could go all night

You’re like champagne on the floor boards
Thought I cleaned you up 'til I found more
Yeah, I thought I cleaned you up, but I found more
You’re like a love seat on the front porch
Don’t make any sense, but damn hard to ignore
How can something so sweet be an eyesore?

And I try to forget that you were mine, to forget last night
But my feet keep sticking to the beer spilled in the kitchen, oh
And now that everyone’s gone, I'ma cry if I want

You and me were one big party
Wasn’t it the best of times?
Strangers when the whole thing started
Thought that we could go all night
But eventually it’s 6 in the morning
You wake up and you want to cry
You got a headache and you’re feeling sorry
I guess the hardest thing about a party
Is knowing when to say goodnight 
Is knowing when to say goodnight 

You’re like a wounded soldier on the table
Gotta throw you out, such a waste, though
Shame throwing out such a pretty face, though

And I try 
To forget that you were mine 
To forget last night
But my ears keep ringing from the fuck you’s you were singing, oh
And now that everyone’s gone, I'ma cry if I want

You and me were one big party
Wasn’t it the best of times? 
Strangers when the whole thing started

But eventually it’s 6 in the morning
You wake up and you want to cry
You got a headache and you’re feeling sorry
I guess the hardest thing about a party
Is knowing when to say goodnight 
Is knowing when to say goodnight 
And I’m trying to remember
The way it all played out, played out
We were drinking and screaming
Then you found your way out, way out
And I’m trying to remember
The way it all played out, played out
We were drinking and screaming
Then you found your way out, way out

You and me were one big party
Wasn’t it the best of times?

Gia Woods,EGO by Gia Woods,"
Up and down like a rollercoaster
Shut me out, then you say come over
Call it off too many times for closure
Call it off too many times and now it’s

Runnin' 'round my head, insecurity
Tangled in my bed when you're in my sheets
All the shit you said show up in my dreams, get the best of me

My ego loves to rough it up with your ego
Throwin' uppercuts to get equal
That's just how it goes
You want love and control, but you can’t have both
'
Cause egos always gonna make us act crazy
Guess I'm gonna love you 'til you hate me
That's just how it goes
You want love and control, but you can't have, can't have both

Dance round all the same old problems
Call 'em out, but we still don't stop 'em
Every night find a way to top 'em
Every night find a way to have 'em

Runnin' 'round the room, insecurity
What I feel for you starts to worry me

All my exes said the same thing
Maybe they're right
I'm the high they're always chasing
But they're never mine

Oh, baby, I don't need no saving
I'm okay with crazy
I don't mind that everything sucks and I think it's amazing

Looks like we just found a new one
It won't take me long
No, it won't take me long
To forget what I'm mad about

I couldn't leave you
Even if I want to
Sometimes I really hate you
But I can't live without you

We don't work the way we should
But no one makes me hurt so good
And oh I, oh I
I shouldn't do it but I'm into it
Always let you mess me up
But I guess that's just our kinda love
And oh I, oh I
I shouldn't do it but I'm into it

When I look into your eyes
Still get butterflies
But sometimes I think we're cursed
We go head to head
Guess it's what you get
When a flame meets a firework
We got a whole lotta issues
But don't go away 'cause I'll miss you
I don't wanna share mine with nobody else

I couldn't leave you
Even if I want to
Sometimes I really hate you

Craving impact, wanna drive off the road
Eyes are sinking into memories you own
Spill your coffee on my way to your door
Spill my feelings onto your bedroom floor
Like a bad dream
Like a kite in a cave
Feeling useless to you
Feelings taken away
Ooh, taken away
Ooh, taken away

Everything I see, everything I touch
Turn it into gold, melt it into dust
I can never have you
If I don't want to let you go
Ooh, taken away
Ooh, taken away

Run and fall asleep
Over things that I say
Would you read them?
If I had them engraved
On a jet plane
And flew it into your mind
Would they land on your waves?
Would you give me your time?

Ooh, taken away
Ooh, taken away
Ooh, taken away
Ooh, taken away

Listen to you lie
Wishing it was true
Faking every smile
Didn't have a clue
I would never leave you
If you didn't make me go

Lady Gaga,Shallow by Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper,"
Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

I'm fallin'
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

I'm falling
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

In the sha-ha, sha-hallow
In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha, sha-hallow
We're far from the shallow now

Oh, ha, ah, ha
Oh-ah, ha

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now
In the sha-ha, shallow
In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha, shallow
We're far from the shallow now"

I'll pick myself up, but not today
Today I'm a mess, just let me cry, get it all out, baby

Get it all out, baby
Get it all out, baby
Just let me kick, let me scream
Just let me kick, let me scream in my pillow
Just let me get, catch you out 
Just let me get, get you out of my system

I'll stand on my feet, but not today
I'll hit delete, throw it all away
I'll be so sweet right to your face
But when you leave, just let me cry, get it all out, baby
I'll be alright, just gotta play

I'll pick myself up, but not today

You slip your hand under the table at your parents' place
I hate the way

You say that I'm the one after a month
We talk about the future like we're drunk
Won't hold back on you, don't bite your tongue
Don't care what this is gonna do to us

I know I’ll be the one that you will never get over
You can't get over
You'll be the best I've had and I will never recover
So baby get closer

Let's fuck each other up

I'll need therapy
From all of the damage I wish you weren't so good to me
You, you, you, you can't forget
'Cause seven years later, you have to explain to her why you can't commit

I've been spending all my time
Wishing we'd be forever
Imagining you're mine
That we were together
But we were in different places the whole time
We lost the war, but never even had a fight
I wish you made me hate you when we said goodbye

The worst kind of hurt
The kind that just burns
Is when there's no good reason
It didn't work
When you'rе still in love
But it's not enough
And nothing's evеn wrong
But you wish it was

You didn't hurt me
I didn't hurt you
I still want you
But we don't want the same things
We can't be what we were
But I'll always be yours

That's the worst kind of
Worst kind of hurt , worst kind of hurt 

That's the worst kind of
Worst kind of hurt , worst kind of hurt 


You could have cheated or lied
You could have just made it easy
But I know that you tried
And I tried, and we tried, but sometimes
There's nothing you can do
I swear that

The worst kind of hurt 
The kind that just burns
Is when there's no good reason
It didn't work 
When you're still in love
But it's not enough
And nothing's even wrong

Laura Marano,You Can Come to Me by Ross Lynch & Laura Marano,"
When you're on your own
Drowning alone
And you need a rope that can pull you in
Someone will throw it
And when you're afraid
That you're gonna break
And you need a way to feel strong again
Someone will know it

And even when it hurts the most
Try to have a little hope
That someone's gonna be there when you don't
When you don't

If you wanna cry, I'll be your shoulder
If you wanna laugh, I'll be your smile
If you wanna fly, I will be your sky
Anything you need that's what I'll be
You can come to me

You struggle inside
Losing your mind
Fighting and trying to be yourself
When somebody lets you
Out in the cold
But no where to go
Feeling like no one could understand
Then somebody gets you

So take a breath and let it go
And try to have a little hope
'Cause someone's gonna be there when you don't
When you don't

If you wanna cry, I'll be your shoulder
If you wanna laugh, I'll be your smile
If you wanna fly, I will be your sky
Anything you need, that's what I'll be
You can come to me
Like a chain that never breaks
Like a truth that never bends
Like a glue that takes a broken heart and puts it back again
It's the feeling that you get
It's the moment that you know
That no matter what the future holds
You'll never be alone

If you wanna cry, I'll be your shoulder
If you wanna laugh, I'll be your smile
If you wanna fly, I will be your sky
Anything you need, that's what I'll be
If you wanna climb, I'll be your ladder
If you wanna run, I'll be your road

Anything you need, that's what I'll be

Maybe we could've been friends
If I met you in another life
Maybe then we could pretend
There's no gravity in the words we write
Maybe you didn't mean it
Maybe ""blonde"" was the only rhyme
The only rhyme

Want my heart to be breakin', breakin', no
I'm happy and you hate it, hate it, oh
And I'm not asking you to let it go
But you been tellin' your side
So I'll be tellin' mine, oh

You can try
To get under my, under my, under my skin
While hе's on mine
Yeah, all on my, all on my, all on my skin
I wish you knew that еven you
Can't get under my skin if I don't let you in

You're tellin' it how you see it
Like truth is whatever you decide
Some people will believe it
And some will read in between the lines
You're putting me in the spotlight
But I've been under it all my life
Said all my life

Want my heart to be breakin', breakin', no
I'm happy and you hate it, hate it, oh
And I'm not asking you to let it go
But you been tellin' your side
So I'll be tellin' mine

Yeah, all on my, all on my, all on my skin
I wish you knew that even you
Can't get under my skin if I don't let you in, oh
I just hope that one day
We both can laugh about it
When it's not in our face
Won't have to dance around it
Don't drive yourself insane
It won't always be this way

You can try
To get under my, under my, under my skin
While he's on mine
Yeah, all on my, all on my, all on my skin
I wish you knew that even you
Can't get under my skin if I don't let you in"

I'm sorry but, don't wanna talk
I need a moment before I go, it's nothing personal
I draw the blinds, they don't need to see me cry
'Cause even if they understand, they don't understand

So then, when I'm finished
I'm all 'bout my business and ready to save the world
I'm taking my misery, make it my bitch
Can't be everyone's favorite girl

So take aim and fire away
I've never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
The blood moon is on the rise
The fire burning in my eyes
No, nobody but me can keep me safe

Lo siento mucho , pero me voy 
Porque a tu lado me di cuenta que nada soy 
Y me cansé de luchar y de guerrear en vano
De estar en la línea de fuego y de meter la mano
Acepto mis errores, también soy humano
Y tú no vez que lo hago porque te amo 

Pero ya , no tengo más na' que hacer aquí 
Me voy, llegó la hora 'e partir 
De mi propio camino, seguiré lejos de ti

So take aim and fire away

You like New York City in the daytime
I like New York City in the nighttime
You say you like sleeping with the air off
I don't, I need it on
You like the light coming through the windows
I sleep late, so I just keep 'em all closed
You ignore the music on the radio
I don't, I sing along

I don't ask for you to change, baby, no, no, no
And you don't ask for me to change

Tell me how we're not alike
But we work so well and we don't even know why
Funny how the stars crossed right

I have cold blood even in a sweater

Sabrina Carpenter,On Purpose by Sabrina Carpenter,"
Your eyes crashin' into my eyes
Was I accidentally falling in love?
Your words didn't mean to heal the hurt
We're coincidentally more than enough

All these days, I never thought
That I would need someone so much
Who knew?
But I don't think I ever planned
For this helpless circumstance with you

You're scared, I'm nervous
But I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose
Baby, I know it's weird, but it's worth it
'Cause I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose

 Hey, huh
Hey, huh, hey, huh, hey
But I guess that we did it on purpose
 Hey, huh
Hey, huh, hey, huh, hey
But I guess that we did it on purpose

My dreams running into your dreams
It's as if we wished on the same star
And my time changing all of your time
It's a butterfly effect on my heart

All these days, I never thought
That I would need someone so much
Who knew? Who knew?
But I don't think I ever planned
For this helpless circumstance with you
Oh, whoa

You're scared, I'm nervous

I found a love for me
Oh, darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight


Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect

I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight"
Ed Sheeran,Castle on the Hill by Ed Sheeran,"
When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home
And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill"
Ed Sheeran,Perfect Duet by Ed Sheeran & Beyoncé,"
I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well, I found a man stronger than anyone I know
He shares my dreams, I hope that someday we'll share a home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be your girl, you'll be my man
And I see my future in your eyes

Well, baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
while listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress
looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight


Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, while listenin' to our favorite song
I have
faith in what I see
Now I know I have met
an angel in person
And she looks perfect, and he looks perfect
No, I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight"
Ed Sheeran,Happier by Ed Sheeran,"
Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new

'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?

Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling, I am still in love with you

But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I’ll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

‘Cause baby you look happier, you do
I knew one day you’d fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I’ll be waiting here for you"
Ed Sheeran,Supermarket Flowers by Ed Sheeran,"
I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, ""Don't you cry when you're down""
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""

I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""

Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back
He said, ""Hallelujah, you're home"""
Ed Sheeran,Thinking Out Loud by Ed Sheeran,"
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how

People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me, I fall in love with you every single day
I just wanna tell you I am

So honey, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how

People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

That, baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

So baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh baby, we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are"
Ed Sheeran,Galway Girl by Ed Sheeran,"
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some
Doritos
and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

Oh, maybe I came on too strong
Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong
Oh, just a little bit wrong
Baby I apologize for it

I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And jumping in harder than
Ten thousand rocks on the lake

So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

You're a mystery
I've travelled the world
And there's no other girl like you
No one, what's your history?

Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
'Cause I heard you do, mmm

I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And lie awake, every day
Don't know how much I can take

So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
Sitting back, looking at
Every mess that I made

So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
Let me know the truth

What if, what if we run away?
What if, what if we left today?
What if we said goodbye to safe and sound?
And what if, what if we're hard to find?
What if, what if we lost our minds?
What if we let them fall behind and they're never found?

And when the lights start flashing like a photobooth
And the stars exploding, we’ll be fireproof

My youth, my youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth, my youth is yours
Runaway now and forevermore
My youth, my youth is yours
A truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours

What if, what if we start to drive?
What if, what if we close our eyes?
What if we're speeding through red lights into paradise?
Cause we've no time for getting old
Mortal body; timeless souls
Cross your fingers, here we go

And when the lights start flashing like a photobooth
And the stars exploding, we’ll be fireproof

Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls

Runaway now and forevermore

I woke up pissed off today
And lately, everyone feels fake
Somewhere, I lost a piece of me
Smoking cigarettes on balconies

But I can't do this alone
Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
Need you on the other side

So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
But you gotta be there for me too

But you gotta be there for me too

Last year took a toll on me
But I made it with you next to me
Around the world and back again
I hope you're waiting at the end

But I can't do this alone
Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
Need you on the other side

So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
I'll be loud for you

I got you, I promise
Let me be honest
Love is a road that goes both ways
When your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
But you gotta be there for me too
But you gotta be there for me too

Boy, I'm holding on to something
Won't let go of you for nothing
I'm running, running, just to keep my hands on you
There was a time that I was so blue
What I got to do to show you
I'm running, running, just to keep my hands on you

Troye Sivan,Strawberries & Cigarettes by Troye Sivan,"
Remember when we first met?
You said, ""Light my cigarette""
So I lied to my mum and dad
I jumped the fence and I ran
But we couldn't go very far
'Cause you locked your keys in your car
So you sat and stared at my lips
And I could already feel your kiss

Long nights, daydreams
Sugar and smoke rings, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Headlights on me
Racing to 60, I've been a fool
Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you

Remember when you taught me fate?
Said it'd all be worth the wait
Like that night in the back of the cab
When your fingers walked in my hand
Next day, nothin' on my phone
But I can still smell you on my clothes
Always hoping that things would change
But we went right back to your games

Long nights, daydreams
Sugar and smoke rings, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Headlights on me
Racing to 60, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you

And even if I run away
Give my heart a holiday
Still, strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
You always leave me wanting more
I can't shake my hunger for
Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Yeah, they always taste like you, you
Long nights, daydreams
With that sugar and smoke rings
Always taste like you
Headlights on me

Racing to 60, I've been a fool

Still, strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans

Lighters and candy, I've been a fool

Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you"

The change in the wind took you down to your knees

The world sang along to it falling apart

But I sympathize, and I recognize
And baby, I apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things

I got the good side of life
Travelled the universe twice
So many thoughts I wanted to share
But I didn't call because it wouldn't be fair
Then I got the good side of new
Found arms to fall right into
I know how it looked, it wasn't the plan
And some day I hope that you'll understand

And catch up on everything
I'll say I'm proud of all that you've done
You taught me the ropes, and you taught me to love

But I sympathize, and I recognize
And baby, I apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things
Sympathize, recognize
Apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things"

At 5 in the morning, I would un-fuck you

Honestly, this party's over
Everyone here shoulda gone home
But I'm afraid of being sober
'Cause the first thing I do when I'm alone

I start touching myself to the photos that you used to send me
I should have deleted, but kept it a secret
Is that crazy to do?
So I squeeze out the lime on the ice of my drink
And the juice hits the cuts on my fingers
It still doesn't burn as much as the thought of you

Wish I could get a little un-drunk so I could un-call you
At 5 in the morning, I would un-fuck you
But some things you can't undo
I wish I could un-kiss the room full of strangers
So I could un-spite you, un-lose my temper
But some things you can't undo
And one of them's you

I'm afraid to turn the lights on
I don't wanna face this rebound
Is it weird if I come over?
I want to, but I know that she's around

Been through every emotion
Right now, I'm sad and broken
Like the bottles on the floor, but I'm too buzzed to clean 'em up
Wish I could get a little un-drunk
So I could, I could un-love you

I know it's been a couple months, yeah, we should meet up
I'll meet you downstairs at the subway station, oh
We don't gotta talk about us, how we messed it up
We could keep it light, just a conversation
No expectation

Just a one-minute walk
And it's just two blocks
And three drinks later
You're back in my arms

I just had sex with my ex
In a New York apartment, ah
Now I'm a mess, I'm obsessed
I'm right back where I started, broken-hearted
Every time you call me, I'll pick up again
Back into my feelings, back into your bed, oh

In a New York apartment
Ooh, I thought it'd be harmless

Gotta catch my flight, but I want more time
Gimme one more night to be wrapped up in you, oh

We got a lot of time to get it right
It feels good to mess it up, maybe don't think about it
Going late night, who needs a fantasy?
Buzzing on Hennessy, drives like a Kennedy
And you're my nation, my revolution
Living right now, well, you can call it disillusion

Until tomorrow comes
This is how we run

So take the good stuff, honey
That money just won't buy
Spend it up, up however we like
Take the good stuff, honey
That money just won't buy
Don't try to save us 'cause we're doing it right

If I'm gonna waste it
Gonna waste it on you
It's my life
If I'm gonna waste it
I'll be wasted on you

Look what you did to me, a rebel born free
Running wild through the concrete jungle
Now I can't seem to stay away
Hell, I know that I'm gonna pay
But I do it anyway 

You're the ultimate high that I'm trippin' on
You're the edge of the cliff that I'm hangin' on
Until tomorrow comes
This is how we run

Gonna waste it on you

If I'm gonna waste it
I'll be wasted on you

On you, on you
Wasted on you
On you, on you
Wasted on you

I tell myself, if I'm gonna fall
It'll be from high places
Even when it hurts, at least we loved hard
Now, didn't we, baby?

We are, we are the wasted youth
We are, we are the wasted youth

We started out as friends in the Lower East
Did a couple drugs at the house parties
Late nights in taxi cabs
Wish I could have 'em back
'Cause there's a lot of things that I never said
Now you're with somebody else in a different bed
You're happy, I could see
And that's so hard for me

When you walk in the bar with someone, holding hands
Introduce me to her, say I'm just an old friend
And you ask how I've been
I say I'm doing fine, but I'm lying

I take another shot, need the novocaine
Wish it would numb my heart way it numbs my brain
But it's all love
I don't feel it, but it's all love
The way you kiss on her neck with that look in your eyes
Do it right in front of me, kinda makes me wanna die
But it's all love
I hate the feeling, but it's all love

Should we forget about the past? Is that how you cope?
Should we drink a little more of that rum and Coke?
I don't know how to be
When she looks a bit like me

When you walk in the bar with someone, holding hands
Introduce me to her, say I'm just an old friend
And you ask how I've been
I say I'm doing fine, but I'm fuckin' lying

I take another shot, need the novocaine

Do it right in front of me, kinda makes me wanna die

Do it right in front of me, kinda makes me wanna die

I poured you a glass of wine
And drank it for the second time
Then 7 PM turned to 10
I'm still alone and my lips are red
But not in a good way
And you're about to walk in that door
And say some shit you said before
You're getting so repetitive
I'm finishing your sentences
But not in a good way

I kinda like it when you hurt me
'Cause you come over saying sorry
So I put up with your lies just to have you for the night, baby
I kinda like it when you hurt me
I start believing all your stories
But I'd rather hear you lie than to hear you say goodbye to me

So if you're gonna lie, do it in my bed
If you're gonna lie, at least do it in my bed
So if you're gonna lie, do it in my bed
If you're gonna lie, make it worth it 

You cut me down, you cut me deep
You say so many names in your sleep
Yeah, I can tell you've been having fun
I don't recognize a single one
Fuck you been doing? Mmm

Are you holding back something that you're dying to say?

Me, too

Are you losing your mind thinking what will it take
To make somebody listen to you?
Me, too

It's the room full of rumors and everybody starin'
Did they tell you you were asking for it by what you were wearin'?

I can hear the shots from the fireworks soar, and the sounds of the battle

Drop down, know I'm on top, when the arrows are drawn, the sergeant's on the saddle
This ain't the type of love that sees a lot of give and take
And I don't know how we push and pull, but I know we'll never break
Bang, bang, I can hear the shots
But I like the way you feel in the flames of the candle

Too late to leave these walls
This castle's been surrounded
Won't stay to watch it fall around us

Bring the big guns out, shoot now
I'll make the drums beat harder for you
Red on the ground, bleed out
I'll rub the colors on my face to prove

Starin' at two different views on your window ledge
Coffee has gone cold, it's like time froze
There you go wishin', floatin' down our wishin' well
It's like I'm always causin' problems, causin' hell
I didn't mean to put you through this, I can tell
We cannot sweep this under the carpet 

I hope that I can turn back the time
To make it all alright, all alright for us
I'll promise to build a new world
For us two with you in the middle





Lyin' down beside you, what's goin' through your head?
The silence in the air felt like my soul froze
Am I just overthinkin' feelings I conceal?
This gut feelin' I'm tryna get off me as well
I hope we find our missin' pieces and just chill
We cannot sweep it under the carpet 

I hope that I can turn back the time
To make it all alright, all alright for us
I'll promise to build a new world
For us two with you in the middle

Could you believe? I could be different
I'll be the difference, I'll lift you high
And I understand your hesitation
My reputation, it's no surprise

So let me redefine you
And you can see the tide move
Just like tears in the eyes do
And when you're feeling alone
Oh, baby, I'll be right here
Between the sea and silence
So breathe easy my dear
You can find sunshine in the rain

I will come running when you call my name
Even a broken heart can beat again
Forget about the one who caused you pain
I swear I'll love you in a different way


I know that love is so unforgiving
You've been a victim too many times
And I'll be the thread, hold you together
I'll be forever, will you be mine?

So let me redefine you
And you can see the tide move
Just like tears in the eyes do
And when you're feeling alone
Oh, baby, I'll be right here
Between the sea and silence
So breathe easy my dear
You can find sunshine in the rain

I will come running when you call my name
Even a broken heart can beat again
Forget about the one who caused you pain
I swear I'll love you in a different way
Hey, hey, hey
I swear I'll love you in a different way
Hey, hey, hey

Look at those thighs

Next time just lie, mhm

I don’t know if I am happy with anything anymore
I’m not complaining I’m just a bit unsure about
Who I am where I stand, when does my part fit in
Seems like everybody’s falling in love with their path
And I’m hesitating and building my tracks
If somebody else tells me just to relax

I wish it was that easy to shut it all off
I wish it was that simple to know I’m enough
I wish I could pretend that I’m doing it
And I’m not wrapped up and I’m losing it
When I’m out with my friends I’m not really though I’m just waiting for my dreams to call up my phone I can’t keep this up I’m original
And it’s killing me more than you know

I just want to be here now
Cause I know that I can be here now
Maybe I should be more open about it but don’t gеt me started
Cause oncе in my head it’s kind of a mess
I’m trying to clean
Don’t know what I should keep

I wish it was that easy to shut it all off

And it’s killing me more than you know

I just want to be here now
Cause I know that I can be here now

I don’t want to be fake
Unoriginal
Trying to keep up with all these decisions now
I just wanna be here now be here now I just wanna be here now
And I wanna stay for a minute now
Cause I just want 60 seconds for myself
I just wanna be here now be here now I just wanna be here now"

See my reflection who am I really supposed to see

Ah, ah

When I met you that day in June, know you were everything I dreamed about
Said that you can only stay 'til two and that your momma would be freaking out
Driving through streetlights, listening to b-sides thinking baby I don't want it to end 
I never wanted anyone but you, but we can never get the timing down

Every time that we get close
Oh, I can't stand the thought of letting go

Remember way back when in August 
The summer night out at your cottage 
Always in the right place at the wrong time 
Things changе but it's alright 
The truth is I still get nostalgic, and I go back to the first night

He's kinda borin' but he treats me nice
Think you and him might wear the same cologne
I kinda like it but it don't feel right
Funny how, one night and a quick goodye
Got me callin' you at 3AM like
Come through when I'm home alone, I know we shouldn't but it crossed my mind

Every single place I go
I see your face and wonder if you're close

Remember way back when in August 
The summer night out at your cottage 
Always in the right place at the wrong time 
Things change but it's alright 
The truth is I still get nostalgic, and I go back to the first night 
And I go back to the first night

In another life I'd say it, you're the only one I want
In and out my life, I hate this, when's it gonna be just us?
Sick and tired of these daydreams 
I want love to have some meaning oh, oh
Are you thinking 'bout the same thing, do you go back?
'Cause I go back to the first night
Remember way back when in August 
The summer night out at your cottage 
Always in the right place at the wrong time 
Things change but it's alright 
The truth is I still get nostalgic, and I go back to the first night"

Le'ts go
And get in the car, and don't tell our jobs where we're going
'Cause I don't even know yet
Let's talk
About what we want, not scared to come off like I'm needy
I just have a lot of feelings

I'ma get a tattoo with a boy I just met
I'ma go on a trip even though I'm in debt
Ain't it fun being reckless?
Life's too short to be stressing
Let's just do it for the hell of it

Let's just do it, Let's just do it
Let's just do it for the hell it
Let's just do it, Let's just do it
Hell of it, hell of it

Let's dance
With our feet in the sand, until 4 A.M. in the morning
Don't remember being sober
Let's live
Off of our screen, oh can we just be in the moment 
If you didn't notice

I'ma dye my hair blue and then really hate it
I'ma sleep on a couch reconnect with my friends
Ain't it fun being reckless?
Life's too short to be stressing
Let's just do it for the hell of it

Let's just do it, let's just do it
Let's just do it for the hell it

Hell of it, hell of it

Hell of it, hell of it

Do it for, do it for, do-do-do it for the hell of it
Do it for, do it for, do-do-do it for the hell of it
Do it for, do it for, do-do-do it for the hell of it
Do it for, do it for, do-do-do it for the hell of it
Let's just do it, let's just do it

Let's just do it, let's just do it
Let's just do it for the hell it
Let's just do it, let's just do it
Hell of it, hell of it

Let's kiss
A million thousand strangers
Throwing up in someone's basement
Fall in love so hard you taste it
Crash your car and make a payment
Getting all that independence
Forgetting what that one guy said
Run away from all your problems
Keep saying you'll drop that album"

I don't trust myself at all

Oh, I'm so over it
So why do your calls make me feel like this?

'Cause every time I let you in
I realize that I'm settlin'
And that's not a good feelin'

'Cause you're really nice to think about, but that's about it
And my heart is unavailable and you're playin' tricks
I'm selfish and you're jealous

Why do I give into you?
I know I'm bеing used
I tell myself ""Just say no""
Thеn wake up in your bed without my clothes
And I'm like ""Damn, I did this shit again""
Why can't we just be friends?
I don't want a life with you
But you give me those eyes and I break my rules

I realize that I'm settlin'

Gryffin,Feel Good by Gryffin & ILLENIUM (Ft. Daya),"
Yeah, I doubt, I doubt myself
And I'm too proud to ask for help
When you see me beside myself
I don't have to explain it, baby
Yeah, I'm over picking fights
And trying to mend it with the high
Don't wanna know that I'm not right
I know that I've been lately, lately

Yeah, sometimes I need someone to pick me up
Overdose my mind with the things I love
You can take me there
When my heart beats, when my heart beats free

Take my hand in the middle of a crisis
Pull me close, show me, baby, where the light is
I was scared of a heart I couldn't silence
But you make me, you make me feel good, I like it
Take my hand in the middle of a crisis
Pull me close, show me, baby, where the light is
I was scared of a heart I couldn't silence
But you make me, you make me feel good, I like it

You make me, you make me feel good

Yeah, I get over-overwhelmed
When all these problems burn like hell
Maybe I just need a friend
Who never calls me crazy, crazy

You pull me off the front line before I run
Keep me cool, when I get overdone
You can take me there
When my heart speaks, when my heart speaks free

Take my hand in the middle of a crisis
Pull me close, show me, baby, where the light is
I was scared of a heart I couldn't silence
But you make me, you make me feel good, I like it
Take my hand in the middle of a crisis
Pull me close, show me, baby, where the light is
I was scared of a heart I couldn't silence
But you make me, you make me feel good, I like it
You make me, you make me feel good, I like it, I like it
You make me, you make me feel good

Taking the weights off
To help with the pressure
And I was here stressing
Thinking it mattered
Been with you for hours, but it feels like seconds
It's only moments and I'm in heaven
It's only moments and I'm in heaven, oh

You make me feel good
You make me feel good
You make me, you make me feel good, I like it

Take my hand in the middle of a crisis
Pull me close, show me, baby, where the light is
I was scared of a heart I couldn't silence

Don't lie, I know you been thinking it
And two times, you let it slip from your lips
You got too much pride to make any promises
Thinking that we got time, and you wanna keep it in

I want you out in the pouring rain
I want you down on your knees
Praying to God that I feel the same
I'm right here, baby, so please

Hold me up, tie me down
'Cause I never wanna leave your side
I swear to never let you down
And it's been eatin' me alive
You can take me home
You can never let me go
Hold me up, hold me up
And tie me, tie me down, down 
And tie me, tie me down, down
And tie me, tie me down, down 
And tie me, tie me down, down

Nine lives until you fall at my feet
Don't hide, you're wasting your energy
You're not shy, so baby, it's useless
So don't try, 'cause you'll end up losing it

I want you out in the pouring rain
I want you down on your knees
Praying to God that I'll feel the same
I'm right here, baby, so please

Hold me up, tie me down
'Cause I never wanna leave your side
I swear to never let you down
And it's been eatin' me alive

You can never let me go
Hold me up, hold me up
And tie me, tie me down, down 
And tie me, tie me down, down
And tie me, tie me down, down 
And tie me, tie me down, down

So wrap your arms around my chest
And I'll put my hands around your neck

You push and you pull, but you should stay
Stay
Hold me up, tie me down

I'll tell you something you need to know
Nothing I can say phone to phone
I'll tell you something, but you have to sit close
You're the one that I miss the most

I've heard that you're happy
And maybe it's selfish of me
To want you back this time
I know we decided
It's better if we both were free
But it kills me now

We said our last goodbye
Won't you stay the night
Even just for a moment?
Perfect lie, pretend we're fine
Even just for a moment
Though we're over, we're so not over
Pull me close, I need closure
This is our last goodbye
Stay the night, even just for a moment

Even just for a moment

When you're not hurting
It's hurting me 
I'm blinded by the past
I'm lost at sea 

I've heard that you're happy
And maybe it's selfish of me
To want you back this time
I know we decided
It's better if we both were free
But it kills me now

We said our last goodbye
Won't you stay the night

Perfect lie, pretend we're fine

Thought I saw you at our bar last night

Hid in the bathroom, I just couldn't say hi


'
Cause I took so much time to reset my life
But in just one look, I'm back
Forget that I could have anyone I like
But now all I remember is what we had

Nobody, nobody, nobody compares to you
Somebody, somebody please help me get over you
'Cause it feels like I've been wasting my time
In all the wrong places, on all the wrong faces
Nobody compares to you, ooh-oh
Nobody compares to you, ooh-ooh
Nobody compares to you

Nobody compares to you
Nobody compares to you, ooh-ooh

What should I do? Maybe I'll move away

Start somewhere new, I'll let you have LA

But in just one look, I'm back

Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody compares to you, to you, ooh
You're once in a lifetime
Better than New Year's at midnight
Wanna grab on and hold tight
And I won't let go
I hope you can hear this

Your lips I wanna kiss

Gryffin,Whole Heart by Gryffin & Bipolar Sunshine,"
We got problems in the streets again
Drowning in the violence, it's getting pretty tense
A lot of hunger in the faces I see
A lot of bitterness, communal emptiness

Don't trust the water, friend
Chemicals hide with the skeletons
Don't trust that false pretense
Counterfeit lies are your best defense

I said, you've got to, got to, got to go whole heart
Yeah, darling, darling, darling, go whole heart
You've got to, got to, got to go whole heart
Yeah, darling, darling, darling, go whole heart

We got issues that we can't change
As quickly as we'd like to, as we need to
And I'm worried it will back spin
Pulling out the lynch pin, leaving us victims

Don't trust the water, friend
Chemicals hide with the skeletons
Don't trust that false pretense
Counterfeit lies are your best defense

I said, you've got to, got to, got to go whole heart
Yeah, darling, darling, darling, go whole heart
You've got to, got to, got to go whole heart
Yeah, darling, darling, darling, go whole heart

I said, you've got to, got to, got to go whole heart
Yeah, darling, darling, darling, go

Head first, past the point of no return
It's the only way left to go
Can't keep taking while the years go by
Gotta go whole heart this time
You gotta go whole heart
You gotta go whole heart this time
You gotta go whole heart this time
I said, you've got to, got to, got to go whole heart
Yeah, darling, darling, darling, go whole heart

And in this final hour, look what I found
I got this whole damn thing the wrong way around

They can say what they like
Won't keep me up at night, no
People gonna judge and people gonna talk

Won't keep me up at night

And maybe we'll never learn
But as the dust settles down, I'm glad you're here
I feel I'm finally heading home
Heading home
Heading home

Heading home

All messed up, all over you

Heart's beating wild
Like it's strong and could never break

Then you meet your first love
Just to learn a lesson
Guess it's kinda fun in a funny way
Then it gets deeper
You say, ""I'll never leave ya""
'Til you get scared and you run away
Remember what I say

You can cry
'Cause your tears are gonna dry
I wouldn't lie
Cross my heart and hope to die
I hope you know that I will be here
With my shoulder by your side
So cry
You can leave it all behind tonight

Cry, I
You can leave it all behind

Now you're up in the night
Thinking 'bout a call that you never made
You work for a life
That you don't want anyway

Then you meet a real one
Learn another lesson
Guess it's kinda fun in a funny way
Then you wanna be heard
Scream until your chest hurts
Are you gonna stay or run away?
Hear me when I say
