Drug houses , lookin' like Peru 
Graduated , I was overdue 
Pink molly , I can barely move 
Ask about me , I'm gon' bust a move

Red light, green light, red light, green light

We like fast cars, fast money, fast life, fast broads
Egotistic, goin' ballistic, why God?
Born warrior, lookin' for euphoria
But I don't see it
,
I don't feel it, I'm paraplegic
Tapped in when I'm maxed in Comp-Town with the MAC-10s
And the pumps in the background
I was absent
Never OG, standout, I was lackin'
Everything else, but doubt
in the Magnum
Holdin' Magnums with a Magnum
Nigga, ad-lib and I sing out loud
Never had friends, never had ends, never had hope
They was like, ""Nope,"" I was like, ""Bùyào, bùyào""

Tee off the day, know we off the, be off the, eat off your plate
Throw me off, I be, ""Off ya head""
Well ate, on C4, I'm way off the edge
Fuck integrity, fuck your pedigree, fuck your feelings, fuck your culture
Fuck your moral, fuck your family, fuck your tribe
Fuck your land, fuck your children, fuck your wives
Who am I? Not your father, not your brother
Not your reason, not your future
Not your comfort, not your reverence, not your glory
Not your heaven, not your angel, not your spirit
Not your message, not your freedom
Not your people, not your neighbor
Not your baby, not your equal
Not the title y'all want me under

Future,Oldie by Odd Future,"
Yo, shout out to everybody that worked on the album, you feel me, son?
Yo, shouts out to Ty Dollas
Shouts out to Hodgy Daddies, shouts out to Left Brizzle
Shouts out to Domyen, shouts out to Frankie Ocean
Shouts out to Syd the Dude
Shouts out to L-Boy, awwwwk
I told you

The big-eared bandit is tossin' all his manners
In a bag and wrappin' them in Saran wrap bandages
Tossin' 'em in baskets with the rest of those sandwiches
So when he says, ""Catch up, nigga,"" it looks like an accident
Um, flowing like my pad is the maxiest
My bitch white and black like she's been mimicking a panda
It's the dark-skinned nigga, kissing bitches in Canada
Then kicking all out like Mr. Lawrence did Pamela
Put her in the chamber all against her Wilt Chamberlain
I never had a reason, nigga, I was just Ableton
Not a fucking Logic-contradicting dickhead

Flyer than an ostrich moshing in a tar pit
Semen-scented cheetah printed tee
In that 'Preme five-panel,
I'll repeat it for the season 
Previous items in the present
With the normal-ass past like I cheated on my team
It's me 

To have some type of knowledge that is one perception
But knowin' you own your opponent is a defeatin' bonus
I'm Zeus to a Kronos,
cartilage cartridge is boneless
Smiles of cowards in lead showers,
dead spouses in red blouses
Children who fled houses on Mustang horses and went joustin'
I'm on my Robin Hood shit, robbing in the hood
Whips, drugs, jewels and your pet, I'm stealin' your rims
Coke diamonds and your Vette,
soldiers lace the fuckin' boot
And salute like the troop, when they shoot, you gon' brrrooop
It's KILLHodgy,
nigga, stay the fuck off my stoop
And out my Kool-Aid, Juice

What's up, bitch?
Hodgy got the juice, I got the gin
Jasper got the Henny, my nigga, we get it in
Wolf Gang party at the hotel
I call a ho, you call a ho, and all the hoes tell
You know Left Brain need a freak 
I need a bitch to go down like a Nitty beat
Yup, uh, and her ass fat
Don't be surprised if I ask where the hash at
Nigga, I'm tryna smoke, bitch, get higher 
Domo, where that Flocka Flame? Talking 'bout a lighter
Still bang salute me or just shoot me
'Cause if you don't salute me then my team will do the shooting
Yeah, my nigga Ace will pull the black jack
The king Mike G is in the cut with the black mac
We like the mafia, bitch, don't get to slacking up
And if these haters acting up, throw 'em in the aqueduct
Free my nigga Earl,
yo, I don't really ask for much
But two bad bitches in front of me cunnilingus

What the fuck is caution?
Often I leave 'em flossing in KAWS,
exes next to coffins
Lost in translation, the dreams you chase
Got you diving for the plates like you stealing home base
That's great, I'm home alone dreaming of two on ones
With Rihanna and Christina Milian, bring it on
And Travis is in the closet organizing and hanging the tramp
Three lettermans that Ace has been making him
No strays while we catching matinees, huh?
I'm getting blazed thinking 'bout those days
I had the top off the GT3 like toupees
One finger in the air,
all's fair when crime pays
My grand scheme of things is to be attached
To the game like bitches to their wedding rings
And you don't even need to look 'cause we gleam obscene
In the light, ride slow to my yellow diamond shining
Like the Batman logo over Gotham, rock LA to Harlem
If you say, ""Get 'em, Mike G,"" then I got 'em
One man squadron, nigga, I'm a problem
From Briggs, I got bars
and plans to
Pimp these Polish bitches into pop stars
Humanity kills, we all suffer from insanity still
And if I said it then it is or it's gonna be real
OF 'til I OD and I probably will, uh
It's still Mr. Smoke-a-Lotta-Pot, get your baby mommy popped
With my other snobby bop, do I love her? Probably not
Know your shit is not as hot as anything I fuckin' drop
Bitch, I'm in the zone,
stand alone, like Macaulay Culk
I've been runnin' blocks since a snotty tot
Big wheel was a big deal with the water Glocks
Now I'm all grown,
same song, just a different waltz
Fire what I talk, but still cooler than an Otter Pop
Op, Dom next shit in your wish list
Mad sick shit, mad dick for your bitches
On some slick shit, your mistress on my hit list
And I'm lifted 'til I'm stiff outta this bitch
Odd in your motherfuckin' area 
Blood clots give me five feet 'fore I bury ya

Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya

Tyler got the mask like he held Jim Carrey up
And fuck your team, ho, nigga, wassup? 
Wolf Gang so you know we not givin' no fucks
You know me dog, I'm a chill in the cut
So I can cut it short, break it down, couple pounds, roll it up

Get me a Persian rug where the center looks like Galaga
Right, right

Rent a supercar for a day
Drive around with your friends,
smoke a gram of that haze
Bro, easy on the ounce, that's a lot for a day
But just enough for a week, my nigga, what can I say?
I'm high and I'm bi, wait, I mean I'm straight
I'ma get you this wine, the runner just brought the grapes
My brother give it some time, Morris, and Day
Course you know the vibe's just as fly as the rhymes
On the song, cut and you could sample the feel
Headphone bleed, make this shit sound real
Used to work the grill, fat burger and fries
Then I made a mil' and them psychics was liars
Now, how many fucking crystal balls can I buy and own?
Humble old me had to flex for the folks
Down in Muscle Beach pumping iron and bone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Yeah, bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone

Goddammit!
Rapping is stupid and it's hard
Gotta do it over and over and over again but here it go

Hey, it's Jasper, not even a rapper
Only on this beat to make my racks grow faster
Got a TV show, so I guess I'm an actor
Pothead, half-baked, lookin' like Chappelle
Rollin' up a blunt with that fire from hell 
Still ignorant, still hit a bitch

Wolf Gang, nigga, so I still don't give a shit 
Catch me in the back with Miley's on my lap

Bong rips as I feel on that little bitch cat


Hah, nigga came through with a 9-bar real quick
Just for the bitches, little bit of money in my pocket
Fuck it, Wolf Gang
Yeah, fuck that

Look, for contrast, here's a pair of lips
Swallowin' sarapin, settin' fire to sheriff's whips

Fuckin' All-American terrorist
Crushin' rapper larynx to feed 'em a fuckin' carrot stick
And me? I just spent a year Ferrisin'
And lost a little sanity to show you what hysterics is
Spit 'til the lips meet the bottom of a barrel,
so that sterile piss
Flow remind these niggas where embarrassed is
Narrow, tight line, might impair him since
I made it back to Fahrenheit,
grimey get dinero type
Feral, fuckin' ill-apparel-wearin' pack of parasites
Threw his own youth off the roof after paradise
La di da di, back in here to fuck the party up
Raidin' fridges, tippin' over vases with a tommy gun
Never dollars, poppa make it rain hockey pucks
And sixty-day chips from fuckin' awesome anonymous
Call him bloated 'til he show 'em that the flow deluxe
Off the wall loafers,
Four Loko in a cobra clutch
Vocals bold and rough, evoke a ho to pose as drum
And let me hit and beat it with a stick until the hole is numb
The culprit of the potent punch
Scoldin' hot as dunkin' scrotum in a Folgers cup
Or Nevada,
drivin' drunk inside a stolen truck
And shittin' like his colon bust
Belly full of chicken and a fifth of old petroleum
Supernova, I'm rollin' over the novices
And roamin' through the forest and spittin' cold as his porridge is
Stay gold 'til the case closed and the story end
Post mortem porkin' this rap shit and record it
To escort it to the morgue again,
lord of lips
Bored of this, forklift the tippy top, best under 40 list
Stormin' the gate, ensurin' the bass
Scorchin', leave these motherfuckers sore in torso and face 
Get at me, we savages, half a pack of Apache
Indian pack of niggas who don't give a fuck
if we nasty as flatulence
As a matter of fact, your swagger is tacky
So see me, you can't, like Crunchy Black catchin' a taxi
Uh, back like lateral passin'
With that motherfuckin' gladiator manner of rappin'
As an addict, I let Percocet and Xannies relax me
Fall back if your paddies is Maxi, please

OF, shit, that's all I got
From my bigger brother Frankie to my little brother Tac
From that father figure Clancy
to that skatey nigga Nak
Shreddin' down 'Fax, Wolf Gang run the fuckin' block
Storefront, knee tat
Book cover is the same lettering on lettermans and cotton socks
And grip tape... and my shoes
Um, I was fifteen when I first drew that donut
Five years later, for our label, yeah, we own it
I started an empire, I ain't even old enough
To drink a fucking beer, I'm tipsy off this soda pop
This is for the niggers in the suburbs
And the white kids with nigga friends that say the n-word
And the ones who got called weird, fag, bitch, nerd
'Cause you was into jazz, kitty cats and Steven Spielberg
They say we ain't actin' right
Always try to turn our fuckin' color into black and white
But they'll never change 'em, never understand 'em
Radical's my anthem, turn my fuckin' amps up
So instead of critiquing and bitchin', bein' mad as fuck
Just admit, not only are we talented, we're rad as fuck, bitches

OFM, banging on your FM
Gnaw,
2011,
yeah

The molly made me fuck her even though she average
Fuck on a basic bitch
We gon' wake up and smoke us a blunt and fuck
She gon' keep it so real with a nigga that
I'ma come back and always gon' fuck with her
Bend the curve in a Spur like a MARTA bus
I was workin' and servin' in Nautica 
I get high 'til I'm higher than Mercury 
Fuck around, teach you that recipe 
Fuck around, you gon' be out of here 
Make her say, ""Huh,"" like a nigga was Juvie
Soon as that work hit the city, we move it
Post up in Onyx and shoot us a movie
Post up in Onyx and shoot us a movie 
Take the tool inside the club and just in case a nigga ever gotta use it 
Get a pint of codeine, pour it up, nigga

Had them bitches fall through fucking like a savage
Heard you tryna swim in the ocean no jacket
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet

Where your ass was at dog, when I was on my come-up?

Like a nigga don't dance, but he make moves
They fuck around, now a nigga gotta shame you
I'm shameless, I be rockin' all my chains too
They told me, ""Boy I think the money's startin' to change you""
Lord save you, Lord save you
'Member runnin' through the city in the same shoes
Now I'm gunnin' in the Benz and the Range too
I'm on point, know a nigga never take two
They said I couldn't reach Mars, so I turned to a star
Now I might have fucked around, might have raised up the bar
Now I'm talkin' cash, talk cash all in my palm
My nigga Cash said, ""Watch what they do for the ones""
I know she wanna be poppin' all over the 'Gram
When the cameras come out, wanna hold my hand
Must be out of your mind, do you know who I am?
Man, you're killin' my vibe, do you know who I am?
Oh, yeah

I might end up with your ho if I take one 
Now days if they don't have a story, they gon' make one 
Last night I gave my heart to a fake one 
I done end up on the blogs with the wrong one 
It's hard to tell the real stories from the fake ones 
'Cause now days if they don't got it they'll make one 
The only time I feel alive when I take 
I wanna vent but I know it ain't safe 
Must be out of your mind, do you know who I am? 
Used to hit it from behind, do you know who I am? 
I can't give you all my time, do you know who I am? 
Make you fall in love tonight, must don't know who I am, I am
I showed you a million, no videos 
I opened up Bentley doors, I invented doors 
Bodies droppin' and we duckin' the law
If you the one to take the blame, you can't say what you saw, no

Still comin' out strong 
Still comin' out strong

Pluto don't dance, but I make moves 
We fucked around, now a nigga gotta shame you 
Shameless, I've been rockin' all my chains too

They might pick you up, just throw you down with the fall
You must not know who I am
You must not know who I am

My brother Casino said you wasn't Freebandz 
And at the time I couldn't see what he was sayin' 
You turned your back, I should have never gave you chances

You're with my ex, while I'm with different color candies

I got Jenny, I got Tammy, I got Sandy
You try to sneak and leave 'em then I leave you stranded

I tell her, ""Look up"" 'cause it's snowin' in Tootsie's
Booked for three years, man, you can't even book me
It's me and Lil Baby, this shit goin' crazy
Wheezy produced it and Weezy F. made me
And she held it down, so she got a Mercedes
Young Money Records, the Army, the Navy
They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me

Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like, ""Yes, indeed""

Cartier glasses, I won't even peek at you
Yellow Ferrari like Pikachu
I got 'em waitin' and watchin' what he gon' do
Tryna peep what I do, tryna steal my moves
25 hundred for a new pair of tennis shoes
The same price, I could make them youngins come and finish you
Lawyer been chargin', he a Jewish like he voodoo
Real dope boy, hundred thousand in Evisu
Presidential tints slide by, we don't see you

I'm gettin' money like I'm from the '80s
Me and Drake 'bout to drop, man, this shit gon' go crazy

I'm straight as the street, man I come from the pavement
A million, all hundreds, it make 'em go crazy

Diamonds dancin' in the dial like this shit is a parade
I don't want your chain, Young GonWunna not a slave
I had to draw the line, too many bitches gettin' saved
TSA harass me, so I took a private plane
These pussy niggas lackin', why I'm workin' on my aim
Drip too hard , charge it to the card 
Designer to the ground, I can barely spell the names
Drip too hard, caution on the floor

Got 'em tuned in like I'm YouTube
Got somethin' on me like it's voodoo
I'll go nuts for you, go cuckoo, lose my cool and all
And I know that shit was wrong, I shouldn't've did what I did

Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'

Take me back, if I was you and I did what I did

Married to the game, I can't make you my fiancée
Bad young boss bitch, treat her like Beyoncé
But damn what them broads say, I fucked them all the first day
And that's why you trippin' anyway, like when I fuck 'em I don't pay
Even if we never speak again
I'll make sure you're ridin' in the latest Benz
Keep your business all apart if you can stay out of mine

Protests and growing national outcry continues over the death of George Floyd

Last night, people protesting in Minneapolis escalated
As demonstrators were lashed by tear gas and rubber bullets
The main message here, the main message here, the main message here
Is that they want to see those officers involved
They want to see those officers arrested
Officers arrested


Trade my 4x4 for a G63, ain't no more free Lil Steve
I gave 'em chance and chance and chance again, I even done told them please
I find it crazy the police'll shoot you and know that you dead, but still tell you to freeze
Fucked up, I seen what I seen
I guess that mean hold him down if he say he can't breathe
It's too many mothers that's grieving
They killing us for no reason
Been going on for too long to get even
Throw us in cages like dogs and hyenas
I went to court and they sent me to prison
My mama was crushed when they said I can't leave
First I was drunk, then I sobered up quick
When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb
He got a life sentence plus
We just some products of our environment
How the fuck they gon' blame us?
You can't fight fire with fire
I know, but at least we can turn up the flames some
Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
I be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces
Fucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better, you gotta know how to survive
Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones to carry a gun when they going outside
Stare in the mirror whenever you drive
Overprotective, go crazy for mine
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Seem like the blind following the blind
Thinking 'bout everything that's going on
I boost security up at my home
I'm with my kind if they right or they wrong
I call him now, he'll pick up the phone
And it's five in the morning, he waking up on it
Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us
While they go home at night, that shit messed up
Knowing we needed help, they neglect us
Wondering who gon' make them respect us
I can see in your eye that you fed up
Fuck around, got my shot, I won't let up
They know that we a problem together
They know that we can storm any weather

It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

Fuck it, I'm goin' on the front line
He gon' bust your ass if you come past that gun line
You know when the storm go away, then the sun shine
You gotta put your head in the game when it's crunch time
I want all my sons to grow up to be monsters
I want all my daughters to show out in public
Seems like we losing our country
But we gotta stand up for something, so this what it comes to
Every video I see on my conscience
I got power, now I gotta say somethin'
Corrupted police been the problem where I'm from
But I'd be lying if I said it was all of them
I ain't do this for the trend, I don't follow them
Altercations with the law, had a lot of them
People speaking for the people, I'm proud of them
Stick together, we can get it up out of them
I can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope, but I'm telling my youngins to vote
I did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope, I was forced to just jump in and go
This bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change
Got time to be serious, no time for no games
We ain't takin' no more, let us go from them chains
God bless they souls, every one of them names
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

They trainin' officers to kill us, then shootin' protestors with these rubber bullets
They regular people, I know that they feel it
These scars too deep to heal us
What happened to COVID? Nobody remember
It ain't makin' sense, I'm just here to vent
It happen to one of your people, it's different
We get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it
Knowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness, I know that I'm gifted
I won't go too deep 'cause I'm scared they'll get me
Ain't scared to admit it, some shit I can't mention
It's people who can, well, here's the chance
I won't take the stand, but I'll take a stand for what I believe
Must not be breathing the air that I breathe
You know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed
I never been a fan of police
But my neighborhood know I try to keep peace
So it's only right that I get in the streets
March for a reason, not just on GP
Our people died for us to be free
Fuck do you mean? This was a dream
Now we got the power that we need to have
They don't want us with it and that's why they mad, yeah
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here

And when you're gone, will I have anything or will I be destroyed? Yеah

Bright lights pass me in the city, it’s emеrgency
I'm thankful 'cause I made it past my thirties, no one murdered me
Still remember vividly the nigga that pulled a gun on me
I'm petrified, but moving like I got no sense of urgency
Pride make a nigga act way harder than he really be
Pride hide the shame when city cut off all utilities
Pride hide the pain of growing up inhaling poverty
Pride make a nigga feel a way that you unfollowed me
Make a nigga flash a thousand like he hit the lottery
Make a baby mama make shit harder than it gotta be
Make you have to take the bitch to court to see your prodigy
Make you have to use your last resort and pull a robbery
Pride be the reason for the family dichotomy
Got uncles and some aunties that's too proud to give apologies
Slowly realizing what the root of all my problems be
It got me feeling different when somebody say they proud of me

Then pay somebody to make sure whatever amount he say he can back it up
Got racks on racks, I'm rackin’ up, stackin' up
You're reachin', I’m actin' up

Break it down, weigh it up, now bag it up
Making five a month, that's regular
Nigga playing with us, that's a negative
Go back to start, that's never

Ain't no off-days on my schedule
Long as I live, we live forever

I don't need 'em, that shit in the past, I'm feelin' like what's next
Got my speed up, foot all on the gas, this not a C8 'Vette
I can beat 'em, I believe in me, just tell me what's the bet
All my pride gone, had to lose it all then I got rich
I own five homes, glad some of this shit starting to make sense
I'm staying hella focused and I can't forget the bigger picture
I can't even hold you, I didn't have shit, I won't forget it
Will I be destroyed?
Come to me with everything, it's starting to get annoying
I'm addicted to promethazine, it's crazy, yeah, I know it

A love letter came through the mail, it said, ""I miss you""
I ripped it up and flushed with the tissue, try to forget you
I ain't got nothing against you, we human, we all got issues
But I'm tired of being tired of being tired
That part of me done died
I see it, then I don't, act like I'm blind
I'm confident it won't be one of mine
I know emotions come with lies, so I tell the truth all the time
Ain't got no sympathy for no bitch
I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit
Jumpin' up on stages, I get two hundred an occasion
Bro had really fucked the game up, we made niggas shut they trap down
They see how I made it, I'm the reason they won't rap now
See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down
The biggest OG's salute me, a stylist can't even style me
The robbers probably wanna get me, I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis
The youngins turn in my city, they try me, I get it cracking
Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping
My people them still steady trapping and they still be getting active
I tell 'em to chill, I'm tryna run up these M's
Paid cash and
then he post the crib

I can't show nobody where my mama live, that's how I 'posed to feel
My niece just asked me were my diamonds real, I said, ""Of course""
I just played the hand that I was dealt, didn't have to force
All around the world they know it's me, they hear my voice
And I done it all in a pair of Diors, yeah

I'm emotionally scarred, that ain't even your fault
But don't listen to them haters tryna fill your ears with salt

All this revenue coming in, I'll probably never spend
I just bought my BM a Benz, now that's another Benz
I just cut off all of my friends and brought my brothers in
I don't see nobody but me, who I'm gon' lose to?
I can't move around without tools, these niggas loose screws
I can see me taking the lead over the new school
They remember me from selling weed at my old school
Only hit it once and now it's old news
Blew up, who the fuck would knew?
Paint my Trackhawk Nipsey Blue
If I get one, you get one too, I really move how bosses move
I never call myself a G.O.A.T., I leave that up to the people
Everybody can't go to the top, I had to leave some people
I'ma be forever scheming, woke up, I thought I was dreaming
Watched my lil' boy play with toys, I just dropped a tear of joy

Told my shooters no mercy or chill button
I done been through so much, I don't feel nothing
I was down off the drugs, I'm exuded
I was locked in my cell 'bout to lose it
They be watching me, clocking my movements
They be plotting on catching me snoozing

I be shitting, I make it look easy
I was innocent, they ain't believe me
Ain't no lie, I be seeing illusions
I can't figure who real, it's confusing
I can't wait to get used to this lifestyle
I remember it could've been lights out
Bitches see me and scream Lil Tjay
Had to fuck up the spot for my B-day
Hit the 'telly and catch me a BJ
Fuck this love, I don't want me a skeezay
Give her dick, now she feel like she need me
I'm too high, always smoking on GG
Bankroll, had to stack my chips
SB, I'ma jack my shit
I know these niggas gon' hate me
I've been working hard, driving me crazy

Big bag don't mean everything wavy
I got 99 problems like JAY-Z
Caught a felony, judge tried to slave me
Lost my grandmother, R.I.P. Mavy
I got money and niggas moved shady
With my brother, I put that on baby
My first car, I might cop a Mercedes
At the stu' every day, can't be lazy
Bodies drop all the time, I don't feel nothing
Swear to God y'all gon' make me go kill something
Told my shooters no mercy or chill button

I was down off the drugs, I'm exuded
I was locked in my cell 'bout to lose it
They be watching me, clocking my movements
They be plotting on catching me snoozing

Dream big, I'ma get to the top
Niggas waiting, the tape 'bout to drop
Told my mother that I'm destined to pop
Y'all ain't think I would get what I got
But I stayed true to myself
No losing myself
Improving myself
I'm on the road to the riches
I'm asking the Lord for forgiveness
I got two or three opps on the hit list
Y'all be talking but ain't never did shit
You'd be better off minding your business
Hard-headed, I just don't like to listen
Mezclando, I stay in the kitchen
Money coming in, my palms is itching
Y'all niggas ain't no competition
Big bag don't mean everything wavy
I got 99 problems like JAY-Z
Caught a felony, judge tried to slave me
Lost my grandmother, R.I.P. Mavy

Lil Tjay,Leaked by Lil Tjay,"
Woah, yeah
Lil Tjay
So I'm skrrting off the scene in a foreign, see me goin' 
Me and YG up in Cali smoking GT out the bong 
Shawty pulled up in a thong, I don't know what she on
If she ask to spend the night then I might give her what she want


Everything is going Gucci, see me Lou V
I can't let a nigga shoot me, I'm in a two seat
And before I speak about it, rather grab a loose leaf
Thirty clip of the dip, and I'm in a hoopty
And we spin the opp block with a mini Uzi
Had to send a couple shots, I been acting bougie
All the sudden all these thots let me in they coochie
They gon' make they pussy pop tryna get my blue cheese
Low-key I be in the streets tryna OD
Low-key 'cause the industry, I'm not the old me
Low-key started peeping niggas not my homies
Phony nigga ate that shit like macaroni
And I remember last year niggas went to Coney
Never thought that this year I'd have a deal with Sony
Lil TJay SB, I'm the one and only
And I just came home and everybody know me
If you want another
G.O.A.T
., guess you gotta clone me
Quit talkin' 'bout some loyalty you never showed me
Nigga, I don't owe you like you never owed me
Once I got a little clout, everybody know me
And we never had to prove this, we really do this
You was never in the field, you was on your school shit
Now my energy is boosted, my mind exuded
They gon' make a nigga lose it, they acting stupid
I got up out my Birkin, it's workin'
She said she a virgin, it's hurtin'
But she ain't never show me love when my pockets hurtin'
Now she see a nigga on, she fucking and slurping
And they see me puttin' on and it got them nervous
We don't never need to ball, I did it on purpose
And I used to play the block with the fiends, got some knots in my jeans
If a nigga talk hot, we gon' pop for his bean

I'm coming strong and they knew that
You ain't no competition, boy, don't think you wanna do that 
You had your chance, but you blew that 
Everybody asking who that? 
The fuck going on?
Someone in my circle started leaking all my songs
I'ma stay ten toes, I'ma still go strong
I don't get these snake niggas, we just can't get along

So I'm skrrting off the scene in a foreign, see me goin'
Me and YG up in Cali smoking GT out the bong
Shawty pulled up in a thong
, I don't know what she on
If she ask to spend the night then I might give her what she want
Fuck her one time, maybe two times if she too fine
Make your boo mine, I'm in the stu', this my new grind
I'm cooking up, I'm cooking up, ain't tryna lose time
I shoot it up, don't give a fuck, ain't tryna lose mine

Gangbang, growing up I was Stain Gang
Stain Gang, promise I was only tryna maintain
Lil TJay SB, that's the gang gang
Ask about me, bet they tell you how my name ring
And I know they gon' hate 'cause I'm up now
I'm at the point where I don't really give a fuck now
Free the guys, I'ma say it 'til they touch down
One day everybody have a bustdown

So I'm skrrting off the scene in a foreign, see me goin'
Me and YG up in Cali smoking GT out the bong
Shawty pulled up in a thong, I don't know what she on
If she ask to spend the night then I might give her what she want
Fuck her one time, maybe two times if she too fine
Make your boo mine, I'm in the stu', this my new grind
I'm cooking up, I'm cooking up, ain't tryna lose time
I shoot it up, don't give a fuck, ain't tryna lose mine

Pussy blow me away
Mm, blow me away

The way you kiss me when I'm strokin' deep inside of it
I swear you ride it so good 
That pussy blow me away
And I been thinkin' 'bout your smile
All mornin' for a while
'Bout the way you twist your face while I'm strokin' in and out
Girl, you shocked me, I'm so wowed
Got me slippin', I'm like, ""How?""
First I met you on the 'Gram, I picked you up and took you out
Let me show you what I'm 'bout
Let them haters run they mouth
You should know you somethin' different 'cause I brought you to my house
Serve you breakfast on my couch
Anything you ever need, you know I'll be there with no doubt
I need you by my side, I hope you're here to ride
I hate to see you hurtin', my lil' baby, wipe your eyes

Baby, let me pull your dress down 
Kiss you from your neck down 
Have you screaming ""Oh""
Baby, just let me pull your dress down
Kiss you from your neck down
Have you screaming ""Oh,"" them sex sounds

Baby, I need you in my life, it's like there's no one there
Nobody, can I turn to you next time there's no one there?
I need a girl to match my loyalty when times get rough
I turn to you 'cause I know damn well you don't give a fuck
About them, let them niggas hate
Either way, regardless what they saying, we'll be great
Let's go explore the whole world, fuck the skippin' states
You got me feelin' different, I might let it go today

Mm-mm-mm, might let it go
Oh, oh, oh, might let it go
Mm-mm-mm, might let it go

Lil Tjay,20/20 by Lil Tjay,"
I feel like the greatest
Only been at this for two years, thank God this shit happened so quick
Fashion me the latest, money comin' in but so do hatred
Shit ain't how I pictured, but I faced it
Emotions, I erased it, fuck havin' feelings, I replaced it
Should've peeped that fu' shit from the basis
This when the mistakes hit, tired of gettin' caught up in this fake shit
I just can't sit comfy with no snake shit

I been holdin' demons inside, I can't lie
So if you ain't ready to die, then don't try
I gotta make it home so my mama don't cry
I'd rather do the sentence, least time'll go by
Feel the pain, so numb, I don't feel nothin'
Shooters still runnin' 'round with no chill button
Still be totin' in the town, finna drill somethin'
Let a nigga run up on me thinkin' I won't kill somethin'

And I keep the gang with me, try it, bet we air shit
Everybody get it, if it's static, we don't spare shit
Really on my bully, 2020, we ain't playin'
Now it's lit for everything, don't care 'bout what you sayin'
Mama, she was prayin', I was on that block late
Really put in twenty years of work, but then I got weight
Sunday I ain't never go to church because that block pay
Big .40 cal' in my shirt, no karate
Fuck what the opps say, fuck what the cops say
Big Smelly drive, E for E, that's the block way
If you feel a way, grrt-baow what the Glock say
All my niggas tryna get the bag, fuck the pop way

I just want my name to be around when I ain't here
Livin' in the moment, but I want this shit for years
They like, ""Tjay, bro, you made it,"" I still feel like I ain't there
A lot of niggas hated, I said, ""Fuck it, I don't care,"" 'cause I'm takin' off
I'ma soon be the greatest, takin' off
I'ma soon be the greatest, takin' off
I'ma soon be the greatest, huh
I'ma soon be the greatest

Words that they did not say, dick suckin' crazy
Everybody tryna beach for clout like it's wavy
Guess I'm just too real, I stood solid, how they made me
I can never be a goofy nigga if they paid me
Songs too heat now, everything is wavy
Lot of niggas think it's competition, they amaze me
I was goin' downhill, jail kinda saved me
Gotta keep the hard work, ain't no gettin' lazy
Smokin' opposition kinda sorta got me dazy
Think you'd last a day up in my shoes, then nigga, trade me
Bitch, I need a billion in blues like I'm JAY-Z
Huh, R.I.P. to Mavy
Bitch, I'm cookin' now, got the sauce like it's gravy
If you want a feature, get your money right and pay me
Still, when the time come, it might be a maybe
It depend on the type of record that you gon' play me
I can't do a wack verse, industry would trade me
Every time you hear my name, you know I'm goin' crazy
Really, I'm a trench kid, SB really made me
Really had the same goal and dream since a baby, ooh-ooh-ooh
I just want my name to be around when I ain't here
Livin' in the moment, but I want this shit for years
They like, ""Tjay, bro, you made it,"" I still feel like I ain't there
A lot of niggas hated, I said, ""Fuck it, I don't care,"" 'cause I'm takin' off
I'ma soon be the greatest, takin' off
I'ma soon be the greatest, takin' off
I'ma soon be the greatest, huh
I'ma soon be the greatest

If we two deep verse your whole block deep
Swear to God, I ain't never gon' fail my man
Money gon' come like the money gon' go
All these fake niggas started getting too close
So I stay with my guys that been by my side
'Cause I know they gon' ride 'til the car can't drive

New drip, had to pick up some sauce
New kicks, I don't care what it cost
Ruthless, I don't care who you lost

Ayy

Just sit back, see how I play it, Shiesty switched it up a notch
Let the dope cook on the stove, we turn the eye down, watch the pot
1017 'round my chain so I tote the same 'mount of shots
Palm Angels denim huggin' me, pockets keep growin', knots
And I ain't had shit when I got out, had to snake my way to the top
Left two men down, we got 'em shot, blrrd, blrrd, switch out the Glock
Mug around me, get you popped, I treat everybody like opps
We move with flip phones and pagers 'cause them iPhonеs get shit locked
My operation too amazing, I posе 'cause the feds watch

Buy firearms and narcotics, do first-degree boys and robberies
Had these rollin' Backwoods of them dead opps, I had to spark
Double cup filled up with Wocky, that medicine in my body
I signed a deal and went and bought a P, put the vacuum seals in my projects
You wanna order up a hunnid? Sixty bags of 'em was garbage
You know I'm slimy as it get, I got outta here off a noggin'
And no, I can never put up my fire', that's a never, not even probably
Since a youngin', been shit poppin', since Truey joggers and Robins
We backseat nigga for flodgin', leave his head like Dennis Rodman's
When I pop out Richard Mille, bet they say Shiesty the hardest 
Beside rap I was gettin' rich regardless
I got this shit forever tatted on me, king of of my apartments
Everybody keep on yappin' till them .62 get to sparkin'
Cut the block off, start the traffic
If the cops come through, this Drac' goin' park it
Blrrd, blrrd, big blrrd, blrrd, ayy, blrrd, blrrd

Just sit back, see how I play it, Shiesty switched it up a notch

And I ain't had shit when I got out, had to snake my way to the top

Mug around me, get you popped, I treat everybody like opps
We move with flip phones and pagers 'cause them iPhones get shit locked
My operation too amazing, I pose 'cause the feds watch
So I stay drippin' on the daily, I know them boy clockin' 

Got a .40 on me right now, I ain't never scared 
I'll shoot this bitch up right now 'cause I never cared 
Gangster to the core with the war like a
leather-head
Eyes hurt, they sore 'cause I seen some shit I never said
Thinking about my boy, don't sip Rémy, I just pour it
We got blow outs on the score, we couldn't catch 'em so his brother dead
Bring it to your door, spent a milli', ran up four
Big ol' hammer like I'm Thor 'cause my Cubans cost a hundred grand
Stupid, is you stupid? I got one up, I shoot it 
I got bands on a man, rock designer like I loot it
Bloody hearts, I'm not cupid, seven cars, this my new whip 
Front line where I stood for your hood, you ain't do shit

And you gotta get patted down before you reach the Choppa house 
And I've been on some new shit, you ain't gotta check my old work 
Ten steps ahead, I was still in school doing my homework 
Quick to set a nigga up, they love to put they hoes first 
See-through clip up in the AUG, I watch the bullets burst 
The city just was getting a lil' too dry, I brought the trouble back 
Me and Hank gon' make sure that he whacked, 'cause we gon' double back

Rep we lit for life, post on the block, this where I'm dyin' at
If I shoot my gun, three hundred shots gon' come behind it
And if I ever ran, the police probably was behind me
Bendin' corners, jumpin' fences, hittin' them gates, and now we lit
Who can't do a show up in the city? Bitch, this my shit

I'm slidin' with thirty, totin' a fifty, sent three shots and bagged him up
Ayy, you remember on that day, I shot so fast the fifty bust?
No, you can't be the gang, you know it's hard for us to gain some trust
You wanna be the gang, you gotta sacrifice your life to us
Now put a cap up on my head, no, I can't never go out bare
Think my shooters, they went deaf or somethin', 'cause all he do is stare
My name spread like the coronavirus, Shiesty in the air
Kick the bitch up out the spot, I caught her tryna leave her hair
Now put a cap up on my head, no, I can't never go out bare

Hoppin' out soon as dark, I been trappin' all through the day
Shooters ready to spark, waitin' on they moment to spray
Calmly burnin' these 'Woods, I been smokin' Runtz to the face
Styrofoam full of mud, my double cup Moochie Grape
Free my niggas from jail, if not, they might escape
Trafficking through the mail, make sure mine come double-taped
Pockets almost obese, I ain't tryna get 'em in shape
Might pop out in the hood, I'm familiar with all the J's
Slimin' shit every day, bitch, we come from catchin' them plays
Catch his ass down bad, I'ma get him up out the way
Hit for like thirty-five, caught him poppin' shit in the A
Told him don't make a move, it's like sixty up in this Drac'

Two Instagram hoes from Compton , I snatched 'em up out my comments 
Them regular clips ain't enough , if you tote a Glock, put a drum in it 
Tryna catch up to me? There's gon' be a whole lotta runnin' 
Eyes in my rearview mirror, I'm on point, won't go for nothin' 
Got twenty shots left up in the K, thought I shot the whole hundred

Pay my tithes at church from hustlin', even the pastor know we thuggin' 
My lil' cousin shot my brother, my brother got back, don't fuck with my cousin
We got Glocks from seventeen, shoot .33, we ain't goin' for nothin' 
He tried to do what I do and I do what I do, he really my baby boy 
Kel Tec 223 with a hundred round drum, that's probably my favorite gun
Everybody know how it go and seen bro on bro, on God, we ain't shootin' no ones
Baby got mills, I come through, foreign
Sell these bands if it ain't no tourin'
Fresh white tee and some Off-White Jordans
Trackhawk too loud, it don't need no horn
Keep my weed, I need my drugs
Got two chefs, gotta feed my son
Soon as my feet hear the screech, I run
Burn through weed every week, buy tons
Nigga, I'ma speak, ain't bitin' my tongue
Only one that's havin' that shit where I'm from

If I catch this opp all by myself, I'ma spray him without 'em
Smoke back-to-back in the Audi, we got this ho partly cloudy
Rocked his ass to sleep, we slimed him out after we took him in
He was clubbin' with the other side, we had to cook his ass
We just shook they block in the   but we had Texas tag
Dropped his ass then hit his nigga up, so we burnt up the Jag
And my hood treat me like Baby, four packs of Fentanyl on me
Hate to serve your lil' old lady, but Granny keep callin' me

Put this Drac' up, I take the carbine instead
Too geeked up , I'm crossin' 'za with the meds 
Free Cub, he threw up on the lick, he was scared
He step on shit, be quiet, 'nough said
Shoot first the motto, you know how we play
Them hollow tips hungry, they ate up his leg
I was just droppin' shit, look where it lead
Now I'm in the hills, I can't spell where we stay

I can't go out like I'm Tony , you can't sneak up on me
I got the whole world in my hands 
He saw how we treat the opponents , I'm still undefeated
When we talkin' 'bout an advance 
Just like the Migos, I slide when I land 
We try to spin through, had to body your mans 
All of my bitches be too slimed in 
When I say come on you, they bangin' you in 
Bang with the coolin' kit on the FN 
I knew I was gon' catch a body at ten 
Gotta hop out on feet every time that we spin 
Wanna get with my gang, cost death to get in 
Try to reach for my chain? You off meth or some med'
Faceshot long range, turn to Steph with the SIG
Keep focus every time, better ask Hi-Tech 
Got a day, goin' out like Pac, I'm big 
Everybody 'round me buyin' green 
And we big C gang, what the fuck you mean? 
Everybody you know my team 
Still posted on the block like I'm Yao Ming 
Chrome Hearts hat with the long sleeves 
In the Rolls-Royce truck blowin' 'za with some freaks
If I want him dead, I just pay, the shit cheap
Keep one in the head,
know LA play for keeps

Just peeped your gang, shit weak 
Can't run it on me, I'm too slimy and neat 
Ayy, shoutout to TP, he cooked up the beat 
Got some tourists in the hills, y'all niggas try that with me
Been and stood front line, real beef 
Tryna slide every day, couldn't eat, shit, sleep 
Get up close on 'em, my technique 
Gotta buy back the block 'cause I run concrete 
Everybody 'round me see red 
Everybody 'round me got one in the head 
Shiesty pulled up shootin', they fled 
Shiesty pulled up shootin', they was tryna fake dead 
Fuck, girl, lemme touch a lil' bread 
Get too mad and I'll pay for some blood to be shed 
Nigga, fuck your gang, you heard what I said 
'Fore you crossed me you only sleep on a bunkbed 
Put this Drac' up, I take the carbine instead 
Too geeked up, I'm crossin' 'za with the meds 
Free Cub, he threw up on the lick, he was scared 
He step on shit , be quiet, 'nough said 
Shoot first the motto, you know how we play 
Them hollow tips hungry, they ate up his leg 
I was just droppin' shit, look where it lead 
Now I'm in the hills, I can't spell where we stay 

No, no
Can't spell where we stayin', blrrrd

It's too late 'cause I'm here to stay and these girls know that I'm nasty 
I sent her back to her boyfriend with my handprint on her ass cheek
City talkin', we takin' notes
Tell 'em all to keep makin' posts
Wish he could, but he can't get close
OG so proud of me that he chokin' up while he makin' toasts
I'm the type that you can't control, said I would, then I made it so
I don't clear up rumors , where's y'all sense of humor? 
I'm done makin' jokes 'cause they got old like baby boomers
Turned my haters to consumers, I make vets feel like they juniors 
Say your time is comin' soon, but just like Oklahoma 
Mine is comin' sooner , I'm just a late bloomer 
I didn't peak in high school, I'm still out here gettin' cuter 
All these social networks and computers
Got these pussies walkin' 'round like they ain't losers

I told you long ago on the road
I got what they waiting for 
I don't run from nothing, dog
Get your soldiers, tell 'em I ain't layin' low

Back with the remix
These boys all my sons like Phoenix

My city and state never ever seen this
Jimmy Neutron, I'm a young boy genius

On the futon, I'ma give her that penis
When this shit's done, I'ma fill up arenas
Ooh, like Gilbert Arenas
Shoot my shot, I'm still with the demons, ooh
I keep it thorough
I got five chicks in New York, that means one in each borough
I'm in the pocket like Burrow
When I'm back home, though, they treat me like Robert De Niro
Took her to Taco Bell, bought her a churro
Took her home, gave her a cinnamon swirl
I left it in, now I got a one-year-old
Zeros on zeros on zeros 
That's what my bank account balance say 
I got a check from the shoe company
Now I do anything that New Balance say
I bought her a plane ticket, out of state
I got me a shorty from 'round the way
Said, ""I'm in town today""
She said she comin' over and she down to stay
I got a hit, she been playin' that shit
So when she pull up on me, I know what she 'bout to say

What's poppin'?
Brand-new whip, just hopped in

I could pass that bitch like Stockton 
Just joshin' 
I'ma spend this holiday locked in 
My body got rid of them toxins 
SportsCenter, top ten

Call up my bitch, tell her, ""Bring me that noggin"" 
Brain real good, she a scholar
I like the thing with low mileage, good brain with no college
Call me DaBaby, no toddler 
I'm real creative and stylish, FN in my denim
I send a hit, make him spin 'em
And I just flew back from L.A. on the jet yesterday 
I go back and forth like I play tennis
I fuck with your ho, yeah, I'm fit for it
Still on the Billboard, the number one song in UK
And I done got so fuckin' rich, all these hoes on my dick
I still don't give a fuck what you say
She eat it like a Pac-Man, nigga 
Whoop a nigga like I'm Batman, nigga

I just pulled up in the Batmobile 
The reason I ain't fuckin' with these rap-ass niggas
'Cause they cap-ass niggas , and they raps ain't real 
Believe me, you wanna keep your life, then take it easy
I'm rockin' water diamonds, need a Squeegee
These niggas watered down, they drinkin' Fiji
My whip is orange and brown like I'm in Cleveland
My bitch is Mello Yello like a soda 
These niggas tattletalers, I'm a soldier
Ayy, somebody tell them niggas that it's over
You know it's Baby, nigga
What's poppin'? 
Brand-new whip, just hopped in 
I got options 
I could pass that bitch like Stockton 

Hop out that Scat and I caught her
I'm out here with somebody daughter
She callin' me daddy, I'm somebody father
I gotta go gets it, I will not go kiss it
Or put my lips on it like somebody water
The diamond, the glacier, the card in the wallet
She pulled up to fuck me but nobody caught her
She told me that she wasn't feelin' my music
I fucked her, she told me, ""It's nobody harder""
And I'm with the G-ski, I need that shit for the freeski
We are not buyin' no pussy you sellin' on Peachtree
It's so much work on my celly
I had to go tell all my bitches, ""Email it to reach me""
All in my DM, I'll follow your BM
She play with the croski, we used to fuck on the lowski
She use to lie on my bed and go lie to your face
And say I'm just a broski, nigga, you knows me
You ain't believe it, you wanted to toast me
I had extendi as long as a ruler
In case you was coolin' and wanna approach me
Dropped the Bentayga, came back in the Cullinan
She wanna fuck again, I want that tongue again
Stuck it so deep that she cough up her lung again
Five-star bitches, they on the run again, run again
Runnin' in diamonds, they illuminatin' the way that I come again
I just put so many pennies on the watch
That I don't ever got to stunt again, nigga, lil' Tory

Gonna drown in this milk like Apple Jacks
I sell a bitch dreams, put tax on that
Lil' slime in that bitch, that's slatt for slatt 
Obama, Presidential Rollie, that's black on black 
Got ninety-nine problems and a bitch ain't one
Yeah, numbers don't lie, this the aftermath 
Yeah, what's poppin'? 
Brand-new phone, just dropped it 
Fuck it, I got options
I bust down a couple Apple Watches

Put a bad bitch and her friends on, ooh, ooh

Dark-haired bitches like Shego 
I like 'em blonde like me though 
Although I'm Don Corleone

Kief all around my pre-roll 
New Orleans, nigga, I'm Creole

This lifestyle don't got many downsides

On the West Coast, yeah, I'm talking 'bout pre-rolls 
Dark haired bitch and she look like Shego 
Hometown hero, feeling myself, can't murder my ego 
She heard of my deep stroke
She said, ""Babe, does it hurt when I deep throat?"" 
Certified freak ho
Hang around us and she learnin' my lingo
Back then, wasn't worried 'bout me though
In the gym tryna work on my free throw
Goddamn 
Spending money at the club like Sam's 
Yes, ma'am
She a lil' freak on cam 
But she don't put this on the 'Gram 
Lil' boys tryna diss on the 'Gram 
I can't switch on the fam 
Shit's hot, hit the switch on the fan 
This where my head is 
I feel resentment from every direction
Even some homies be wearing expressions
I be discouraged from sharing my blessings 
We used to share a connection
Now it just feels like it's wearing and stretching
I'm getting real sick of taking advice
From people that never could stare at reflections 
Somewhere in there is a lesson
Y'all ain't evolvin', it's very depressing
I'm at the club with the basketball team
Me and the Cardinals are sharing a section 
Gotta cherish the present
I'm drinking water and wearing protection
Got a career and I'm very invested
Some people call it a scary obsession 
I like to call it a passion
I can't be sitting relaxin' 
PG, we getting some traction
I'm at the venue, it's packed in 
I'm digging her accent
I got a B.B. Simon belt on me
And she tryna get it unfastened
That's my type of distraction
That's my type and she Latin 
Got my own flow and I'm 'bout to get a patent

You tell me what that means
Make a slick comment and see what that brings
I seen it go down, we can reenact things
Extreme like BMXing
These boys pussy and they PMSing
People in the city see the movement occurring
And say, ""My God, I wanna be in that scene""
Damn right, you wanna be in this scene
She at the video tryna be in this scene
Used to fantasize 'bout bein' this seen 
Bluegrass girl, but she got big dreams
Can't touch me, I got instincts
Locked in the house, but I'm plottin' things
I brought a gang to the party with me
Five white boys, but they not NSYNC 

Fuck what y'all think
Fuck everything that you say about me
My dawgs like to play Madden and 2K
But one thing they don't do is play about me
My homeboy Tyler, he play in South Beach
He told me this summer he gon' fix my jumper
I told Boi-1da that we might got a thumper
I been tryna pop, now I'm on like Shumpert 
Now they on my bumper
Green room chock-full of all my comforts
Hotel room like heaven on earth
Got angels in my bed with some all-white covers
Ace Pro, Nemo, Lucci and Quiiso, Shloob, Clay, 2for
And I got a few more I call my brothers
I got a lot of flows and they all like butter, ooh 
You know what that means
I came home nice, but I'm goin' back mean
I'm 'bout to globe-trot when they know a vaccine
Mothafuckers act lost, but they know exactly what's goin' on
Made a mil' and I don't know what to blow it on
I tell the critics, ""Shut up,"" like my show is on
Gave a T-shirt to her, said, ""Throw it on""
She one of many high school classmates I'm growin' on 
My peers ain't poppin', they don't know what's goin' wrong
Y'all well dressed, but you ain't got soul and you just can't sew it on
I'm tryna tell y'all boys, I got a few songs I could sell y'all boys
I tried it back then, it was, ""Hell nah, boy""

 Yeah
I'm a , I'm a cold-blooded 
Made all this money from doin' this 
​d.a. got that dope

Now count it, five, ten, yeah, fifteen, twenty
Twenty-five, thirty, yeah, get the money
Throw it in the furnace, yeah, this shit be funny
Earn it just to burn it, swag drip—

I used to rock a toboggan
Headphones around my neck, tryna be like Shady
Now the phone that's in my pocket seem to keep vibratin'
I got all these Ronnie Bennetts tryna be my baby
Tryna fiancé me
I take the steering wheel and drive them girls beyond crazy 
I'm on a song with my idol
I'm a cold-blooded version of the song title
I put these diamonds in the ring like they was Shawn Michaels
I can't put the Louis V inside the wash cycle
I take this shit to the cleaners
'Bout to cop me a Bimmer, I got a special demeanor
She was mine when I seen her, I'm gettin' meaner and meaner
Called the front desk and asked for a steamer
I'm a bitch bagger, not a Twitch streamer
I'm eatin' pizza in Little Italy, damn, I used to hit Caesars
She 'bout to finish, but wait a minute, it gets deeper
Same kid just a bit sleeker

Yeah, now count it, five, ten, yeah, fifteen, twenty
Twenty-five, thirty, yeah, get the money
Throw it in the furnace, yeah, this shit be funny
Earn it just to burn it 

They say my killing's horrendous, ""How he still in the business?""
Rich as hell and it's feelin' tremendous
Ma dukes chillin' in Venice, compliments of her eldest descendant
Give hell with these writtens, this shit only propel my ascension
I held my position in any situation that's needed
This year I'm shittin' on niggas for the way we was treated
I see the impact of all my creations increasin'
My step in time with these Pantheons, it all was divine
I'm in this moment of my life where shit is fallin' in line
And lookin' back, I swear to god, you'd think it all was designed
A true movie script, I can't really ever fuck no groupie bitch
All she got is diamonds on her mind on some Uzi shit
A whole generation of geniuses I'm influencin'
I only hang with real niggas who I'm congruent with
I manifest nothing less than the best outcome
Just watch my moves with this next album, nigga

Now count it, five, ten, yeah, fifteen, twenty
Twenty-five, thirty, yeah, get the money
Throw it in the furnace, yeah, this shit be funny
Earn it just to burn it, swag drippin' from me
My sentences are harsh, every single's bar's like a verdict
I say it with conviction, but this time you're not gonna serve it
But as soon as I read it, you know that you're about to get murdered
When I cap, it'll punish, then put you in a box like a juror 
If there's a rapper I haven't ate 
We ain't battled, either that or they won't collaborate
'Cause pad or paper freestyle will settle that debate 
I call it guillotine style 'cause even off the head, I decapitate
Yeah, bitch, I go harder than Carter III 
But I think your thottie just thought of me
She got a body and bottom like Cardi B
And she be stalking me like I was broccoli
I'm getting brain now like a lobotomy
You probably thinkin' you had that shit in the bag like it's colostomy 
It's a red alert, you better skrrt or try to get on my level first
Bitch, I'd had to shovel dirt and dig a hole to get on yours
You bum-bum , look at your broke ass 
It's why you're a bum-bum  'cause your shit is so ass 
Syllable gun-guns , spits and goes ""Hadoo"" 
Only L that I ever took was when I lost Proof 
Only time that I ever got served is that lawsuit when Ma sued 
But, bitch, get out of pocket and I might accost you 
Homicides up the wazoo
 Chain gaudy, probably got more bodi-odi-odies than John do 
Just called Snoop and I talked to him , we all cool 
Dre, me and the Dogg good, Doc, we got you
Got a castle with a solid gold floor 
No I don't, I don't even got a boat nor
Do I got a chauffeur, but a lot to show for
You don't wanna fuck around and start no war 
Twenty more years, I could probably go for
Just like your lip and you got a cold sore
My shit is like motherfuckin' herpes
You ain't ever gonna say I don't got it no more 
Literally it's no quittin' me, you kiddin' me?
Dying laughing is the only way you're killing me
I'm getting rid of ya, get clapped like chlamydia
The wittiest, bitch, I'll snap like a tibia
You wanna get silly with the bars? I'm frivolous
But I'm as gritty and litty as my city is
East side 'til I die, bitch, I will rep 'til the end like a chameleon
Got a killer instinct with the pen's ink and they're in sync like a faucet
How the fuck do I even think of this ridiculous shit?
I'm a quarter of a century deep and I can't be beat 
'Til the day me and the grim reap meet, I'm ten toes down 'til I'm six feet deep 
Windows down in the Benz E jeep hollerin' at a bimbo, beep-beep-beep
She said she fucks with the M-T-B to the M-B: Side B Slim CD
I can see why you envy me, you get no ass like an empty seat 
So this shit comes with a warning for all of you punks and you corny
Little fucks, I woke up on my fuck shit this morning
Now count it, five, ten, yeah, fifteen, twenty
Twenty-five, thirty, yeah, get the money
Throw it in the furnace, yeah, this shit be funny

Shit is the jam, shit is the jam

I can tell who's on the way out 
Twenty-five shows, check the pay out
I ain't goin' home, I'ma stay out 
Motherfuckers hate you when they lookin' for a way out 
I just sit back and let it play out 
And she gon' let me hit it any day now, ooh 
What you gon' say now? Ooh
Oh my, ex-girl got a bae now, ooh
But she still let me stay now, ooh 

I got a Dallas and an H-Town boo
Got a baddie out in Cape Town, too 
Whole gang eatin' steak house food
Get the check, I ain't checkin' what it came out to 
I tell promoters, ""I don't talk about the money
You know who to hand the еnvelope to"" 
Big John got the cash and hе been the go-to
Heard the beat, told Nickie, ""Put it in the Pro Tools""
Got a fountain on the chain and it's indigo blue 
Might fuck around and get a gold tooth
I'm a restaurant-goer, never been to Whole Foods
She gon' listen to the song, say, ""This shit a whole mood""
I'm in the mountains out West on a tour bus
Textin' this chick I used to mess with 
Got her in the bath, doin' video shoots
Tried to send one to me, but it didn't go through 

And she gon' let me hit it any day now, ooh 
What you gon' say now? Ooh
Oh my, my ex girl got a bae now, ooh
But she still let me stay now, ooh

Oh my, ex-girl got a bae now, ooh
But she still let me stay now, ooh 

I get paid to do me, that's a fact check 
I run it up, then retrace my last steps 
I'm in her eardrums talkin' 'bout assets 
""Do you wanna?"", ""Yes,"" hol' up, I ain't even ask yet 
She got her hair done, she finna need it redone 
Boy, that pussy so good 
Stuck it in, damn near almost made me pre-cum 
I let her give me some advice like I need some 
Booked up, tell a dumb bitch, ""Read some"" 
I'm anointed, I'm the boss
I done came out of pocket so much 
You thought that I was disjointed 
They pointed me towards your diss
Um, I'm disappointed 
My ex treat me like I ain't there 
What happened to the feelings and love that we still share? 
Just like the girls who got my name tatted and covered up
I know deep down, under the surface it's still there, still there 
And she gon' let me hit it any day now, ooh
What you gon' say now? Ooh
Oh my, ex-girl got a bae now, ooh
But she still let me stay now, ooh
I can tell who's on the way out

Jack Harlow,Nail Tech by Jack Harlow,"
Mm-mm, mm, mm-mm
Tss

My nail tech knows how to keep a lil' secret
I don't wish for my success, I speak it
I caught a buzz, and you did too, but you tweakin'
I look like I been gettin' money, I reek it
You smell me, that's LV
Walkin' 'round with my chest out, and my skin smooth, I'm healthy
I'm in the mix and I'm handshakin' but most of y'all can't help me 
Most of y'all ain't wealthy , most of y'all just dress like it
I caught the vibe that y'all givin' off, and I'm tryna make myself less like it
This chick got a lil' Porsche body, I might let the bro test drive it
It's hard for me to get excited, I love music, and stress 'bout it
My city haulin' and I'm cosigning this wave
, comin' up next out it
Ridin' 'round and this shotgun in her Tesla
Hangin' both of my legs out of it
, like ""What's up?"" 
I got stakes and they too high now, I can't fuck up 
I like girls that's down to Earth, so don't be stuck up 
I don't take Ls, I give 'em out and I chuck 'em up
First listen, they hearin' this shit like, ""What the fuck?""

Ten toes, that's my MO
Fam' over 'Gram, that's my MO 
Fuck a close friends, I got friends that I keep close
And they let it go while I reload

Like baow, baow, baow
TSA just opened my book-bag up and my chain hittin' like
Baow, baow, baow, baow
The king's back in his hometown
, when them wheels hit and I touchdown they
Baow, baow, baow, baow
She down low, three point stance, I'm back there doin' Jack dance like
Baow, baow, baow, baow

And I'm not no fashionista, but I'm fly though 
And I know I gave up drinkin', but I'm high though 
I told her, ""I don't cum from head, but you can try though"" 
I'm not on top of this shit yet, but I'm that guy though
I take a look 'round and my comp and it's just, uh 
Wide open, big whippin', it slide open 
I notice they treat me like I'm chosen 
Eyes open, heart clean and my mind focused
This shit just keeps goin' how I wrote it
How the hell could you doubt us?
I mean, back then it made sense, but it's like, now what?
Now they down to come 'round just to be 'round us
You ain't one of my dawgs, why do you hound us?
It's very few of you I like, but it's a whole lot of y'all I don't trust
'Cause
Ten toes, that's my MO
Fam' over 'Gram, that's my MO

Better come get her, 'cause your ho on us
Got a bitch from Samoa, look like Moana

Smoking on marijuana 
Go ahead and roll one up 
I got a whole squad, got a whole lineup 
Oh, you tryna put a show on, huh? 

Here I go, na, na
I know a Keisha and I know Lana
They try to get me back, but I'm like, ""No, nah, nah""
I'm sorry, I don't want no drama, nah
That's a hard no, pass
My house real big and my car go fast
In the club smokin' Jack Harlow's gas
But I'm about to do the drugs that Carlos has
Old Miami Vice, 'bout to AT4 it
But I don't show up if they don't pay me for it
New York, party on the eighteenth floor
But her ass so fat that I can't ignore it
Woo, I go crazy for it
But to ride the rides, you gotta be eighteen for it
No games, just some foreplay before it
And the sex so good, she wanna pay me for it, no

I don't wanna hear about no drama

Wait a second, hold on
Why you still got your clothes on?

But once I hit it, so long

Bad bitches put me in they close friends 
From Sactown all the way to Oakland

These ain't no Guess jeans
I dropped out of school, I'm still good at math, but, nigga, don't test me
I played to the left, they went to the right, they tried to finesse me
Still riding 'round with that blicky, I hope they don't catch me
Police had raided our spot, so we went to the next street
Play like I'm dumb, as soon as it pop, I'm goin' retarded
He say I'm hard and he say I'm garbage, I'm rich regardless
We in Miami in the middle of the winter, and we on them jet skis
If we in Atlanta, I'm runnin' the 'Cat and I'm workin' the red key

I cannot mention my homies inside of my song 'cause I know they be trappin' a lot
I can't keep takin' these pills, when I'm in the trenches, they say I be cappin' a lot
I know a nigga who say he got rich off the dope, but I know he be actin' a lot
I know some niggas who said that they took down the city, but niggas be lackin' a lot
Yeah
That shit was awful, nigga had that
dog food
That day they shot you, I slid on a Mongoose
You cannot come back around me, you turned your back on me, I cannot forget
The police was lyin', they say that they caught you, but nigga, they made you admit
Your name was found, you put in that work, they took your stick, you a bitch
Fuck my opps, they be on my dick, they all be mad we rich 

Only twenty-five, livin' like a boss, ridin' 'round with a chauffeur
I don't sell drugs, still be paranoid, keep lookin' over my shoulder
Niggas lyin' like I'm stealin' swag, boy, that's my shit like I wrote it

Uh
These rappers really nice as hell
I'm a different nigga when I'm pissed off
Man, he say he gon' press up on who?
I'ma get the steel like I'm Chris Paul
Back to back suburbans, I'm a big dawg
I was in the slums servin' Fentanyl
Zombieland, junkies havin' withdrawals
I been gettin' to it, lotta missed calls
Turn it off, what the fuck is he talking 'bout?
I should slap you for sayin' he hot as me
I don't know who could fuck with me honestly
They know I'm the man, so they watchin' me
Different color bands like Monopoly
Man, he must not be usin' his head
If he thinkin' I don't keep a Glock with me
That's like suicide if you play with us
Got a better chance at the lottery
Call an ambulance when that chopper sweep
Make the crowd dance, choreography
Once I got a plan, ain't no stoppin' me
Three-car garage, million-dollar crib
With a foreign bitch ridin' on top of me
Lot of people done said I wouldn't be shit
Well, I guess they owe me an apology
These ain't no Guess jeans
I dropped out of school, I'm still good at math, but, nigga, don't test me
I played to the left, they went to the right, they tried to finesse me
Still riding 'round with that blicky, I hope they don't catch me

2 AM at a Broadway bar
She's puttin’ her number in my phone 
Two Bud Lights deep, and she's sayin' things she don’t mean
And you know

I met her down at Aldean's
She said that she saw me walkin' in about a mile away
Bean just had to take her phone and that just took her smile away
She said I'm too drunk and crazy, she don't like the way I dance
I said, ""You don't have to join in,"" she said she'd take a chance
I've been kinda crazy ever since it went down
I get kind of lost, and, baby, this what I found
Girls like you just wanna take me around, around and around

Oh, there’s two things that you’re gonna find out
They don't love you and they only love you right now
If I was smarter, I’da stayed my ass at home
And leave them Broadway girls alone 
Them Broadway girls alone 
Leave them Broadway girls alone

They town just told me, ""Don't trust 'em""
Broadway girls a trap
They on me, they tryna finesse me
They see me with Morgan and know that I rap

I jump on a horse, she get on the back
I went to the bar to go buy her a drink
She listen to P!nk, she told me she not into rap
I can't run out of money
The trenches love me forever
They treat me like Ed in London
Take her to pool, then got a beer for nothin'
Tecovas boots, guitar, cigar, the bar
She ridin' a bull like cars, she usually don't cool with stars

Now, there's two things that you're gonna find out
They don't love you and they only love you right now
If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home
And leave them Broadway girls alone
Broadway girls, Broadway girls
Them Broadway girls alone
Broadway girls, Broadway girls
Them Broadway girls alone
Oh, think I oughta settle down
And find me somethin' I can take back to my hometown, oh
But I told 'em that I'm savage
They just tryna tell me there's

There's two things that you're gonna find out
They don't love you and they only love you right now
If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home
And leave them Broadway girls alone
Two things that you're gonna find out
They don't love you and they only love you right now
If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home

Leave them Broadway girls alone

'Cause I hopped into this industry, dis ain't what they want
See this rap shit ain't shit to me, dis ain't what they want
I got the police all into me, dis ain't what they want
In my own city they hate on me, put weight on me
Fuck TMZ, fuck breaking news and ABC
I can't do no shows 'cause I terrify my city

Niggas gettin' slumped, we the first to get blamed
A nigga try us, he the first one to get changed
They say he snitch, tryna put dirt on my name
They ride on me, ask is Lil Durk my name

Ain't really been in love in a minute

Easy money
It's about to be a surgical summer
Chop the tops off the coupes
The cuatrociento' ochenta y ocho
The Spider joint
And you know we gotta cut the heads off these snakes, right?
Watch the body drop

Drug dealin' aside, ghostwritin' aside
Let's have a heart-to-heart about your pride
Even though you're multi, I see that your soul don't look alive
The M's count different when Baby divides the pie, wait
Let's examine why
Your music for the past few years been angry and full of lies
I'll start it at the home front, ""I'm On One""
Dennis Graham stay off the 'Gram, bitch, I'm on one
You mention wedding ring like it's a bad thing
Your father walked away at five—hell of a dad thing
Marriage is somethin' that Sandi never had, Drake
How you a winner but she keep comin' in last place?
Monkey-suit Dennis, you parade him
A Steve Harvey-suit nigga made him
Confused, always felt you weren't Black enough
Afraid to grow it 'cause your 'fro wouldn't nap enough
Since you name-dropped my fiancée
Let 'em know who you chose as your Beyoncé
Sophie knows better as your baby mother
Cleaned her up for IG, but the stench is on her
A baby's involved, it's deeper than rap
We talkin' character, let me keep with the facts
You are hiding a child, let that boy come home
Deadbeat mothafucka playin' border patrol, ooh
Adonis is your son
And he deserves more than an Adidas press run; that's real
Love that baby, respect that girl
Forget she's a pornstar, let her be your world, yuugh!
How dare you put Ye in my verses?
I'm selfish, I want all of the curses
I'm pre-bookin' the churches, me versus three hearses
If we all go to Hell, it'll be worth it
Already aligned with the greats, and on that same note
The only ones I chase are two ghosts
Still givin' you classics, that's the only thing that dates me
OVO 40, hunched over like he 80—tick, tick, tick
How much time he got? That man is sick, sick, sick
I got the devil flow, nigga—six-six-six
Surgical summer with it—snip, snip, snip
And you don't really want it with him

Surgical Summer, Volume 1
We gon' take this slow
We just gon' peel it back layer-by-layer
Yeah, DAYTONA
Album of the motherfuckin' year

They love a nigga's spirit like Pac at the Coachella
They said Push ain't fit with the umbrella
But I was good with the yay' as a wholesaler
I think it's good that 'Ye got a blow dealer
A hot temper matched with a cold killer
I came aboard for more than just to rhyme with him
Think '99, when Puff woulda had Shyne with him 
Matchin' Daytonas, rose gold on us
Goin' HAM in Ibiza done took a toll on us
But since you overdo it, I'ma pour more
Well if you goin' coupe, I'm goin' four door

'Til we drown all these haters, rest in peace to Whitney Houston
Cars, money, girls and the clothes
Aw, man, you sold your soul
Nah, man, mad people was frontin'
Aw, man, made somethin' from nothin'
Picture workin' so hard and you can't cut through
That can mess up your whole life, like an uncle that touched you
What has the world come to? I'm from the 3-1-2
Where cops don't come through and dreams don't come true
Like there the God go, in his Murcielago
From workin' McDonalds, barely payin' the car note
He even got enough to get his mama a condo
Then they ran up and shot him, right in front of his mom
Forty killings in a weekend, forty killings in a week
Man, the summer too hot, you can feel it in the street
Welcome to Sunday service, if you hope to someday serve us
We got green in our eyes, just follow my Erick Sermon
Did Moses not part the water with the cane?
Did strippers not make an ark when I made it rain?
Did Yeezy not get signed by Hov and Dame?

Six hundred Cuban cigar in the big tub
Medallion on, Dove soap on the fresh cut
With soap suds on the MAC-11
My big lion haven't ate since twelve and it's after seven
We feed the nigga like forty chickens
His tail wag when I send him a bag with just one victim
Uh-huh, now let me show you what my closet on
Gems in the display case, call it a rock-a-thon
I— I got soccer moms payin' for cock
Asians get it from behind while they cleanin' they wok
Comin' with flows that is toxic 
Deadly fumes when I'm in the room
Repercussions occur when you dry snitch
Red light, green light, one, two, three
Look mean, got my machine, cried and hit you, please
Said and shake that body, scar up that body
Should I kill him now Tone?
I said, ""Probably""
Side bets are four and better
Bust hammers with pot holders
And yo, dead a cow for his fuckin' leather
I'm not bow-legged, but old school like Redd Foxx
My favorite color in my hustle days was red tops
My gold eagle arm shitted out a red rock
Threw it off my project roof and saw red dots

No wonder there's diaper rash on my conscience
My teething ring was numbed by the nonsense
Gem Star razor and a dinner plate
Arm & Hammer and a Mason jar, that's my dinner date
Then crack the window in the kitchen, let it ventilate
'Cause I let it sizzle on the stove like a Minute Steak
Nigga, I was crack in the school zone
Two beepers on me, Starter jacket that was two-toned
Four lockers, four different bitches got their mule on
Black Ferris Bueller, cutting school with his jewels on
Couldn't do wrong with a chest full of chains and a arm full of watches
What I sell for pain in the hood, I'm a doctor
Zhivago, tried to fight the urge
Like Ivan Drago, ""If he dies, he dies""
Like Doughboy to Tre, if he rides, he rides
Throwing punches in his room, if he cries, he cries
We don't drink away the pain when a nigga die
We add a link to the chain, inscribe a nigga name in your flesh
We playin' on a higher game of chess
Once you delegate his bills, who gon' fuck his bitch the best?

Smokers repeatedly buying my Sega Genesis
Either that or my auntie was stealing it
Hit the pipe and start feeling it
Ooh, wee, cut me some slack, weed never did that
This was different, geez, Louise, please help me relax
Quantum physics could never show you the world I was in
When I was ten, back when nine ounces had got you ten
And nine times out of ten, niggas don't pay attention
And when it's tension in the air, nines come with extensions
My daddy turned a quarter-piece to a four and a half
Took a L, started selling soap fiends bubble bath
Broke his nails misusing his pinky to treat his nose
Shirt buttoned open,
taco meat laying on his gold
I said, ""Daddy, one day, I'ma get you right with thirty-six zips
One thousand  grams of cocaine, then your name will be rich
Now you can rock it up or sell it soft as leather interior
Drop some ice cubes in it, Deebo on perimeter""
He said, ""Son, how come you think you be my connect?""
I said, ""Pops, your ass is washed up, with all due respect""

Beef is best served like steak: well done
Get a gun in your face, bitch nigga
Beef will have you praying to God
Move your kids, have you hiding your mom
Beef is when you hide behind them other niggas
But they ain't killers they ain't pullin' them triggers, fuck niggas
Beef will have you keying our cars
Heartbroke, yours don't look like ours

Them niggas ain't dying for you

Throwing that flag up running around you hot shit
Taking half of everything you get
Yeah them niggas ain't dying for you

I guess that means you all fucked up
You signed to one nigga that signed to another nigga
That's signed to three niggas, now that's bad luck
Damn that shit even the odds now
You better off selling this hard now
You call it living out your dreams
You can't fly without your wings
You get it
Jeremy Scott's all camouflaged
You can't hide it from yourselves, career sabotaged
I was really in that Travelodge
You just lying through your catalogues
Where the blood and the battle scars
We the ones that judge juggling the gavels on
Put me to the body, nigga
First 48 put us to them bodies, nigga
Round here we don't play that
A to the K that, spray that, lay back
You can keep your beats, nigga
We'd much rather share your bitch, nigga, bitch nigga
3 million can't hide that
It shows in the homes I done tried that
That's why you'll never be my neighbors
Smile as you waving but we know you niggas hate us
Fuck you playing games for
Don't be scared get everything you came for
They got you talking that big shit
Little do you know we don't miss shit
Them niggas using you as a pawn
You see they never loaded they guns
Now you out here all by yourself
Ask Steve Jobs, wealth don't buy health

What's beef? Beef is when you need 2 Gats to go to sleep
Beef is when your moms ain't safe up in the streets

Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life
Did everything you could to be here for the night
Man, it feels good, everything is right
Energy is strong enough to brighten city lights
My whole team winning, no vision on quitting
I'd rather say I did than let them busters say I didn't
Le-le-let 'em talk about it, mane, I'm already living
I risk my life to try every day to go and get it, get it, get it

Came from the bottom, no one said it would be fair
Now I'm on this money, lounging like it's a beach chair
Poppa don't preach, a-all we do is just reach here
Raised 'round killers, we just happy to be here
Spot 'em, got 'em, let your soul pay your dues
While my hoes doing magic, voodoo Moulin Rouge
That's a tactic that they use, fuck 'em high then suck 'em dry
Before you know it, her Q7 is buzzing by
The queen pin to the king pin redeems him
The boat comes, the dope drums, my team wins

Yuugh! This the life that we made
Gun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade

Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life

Triple doubles, both wrist and neck freeze
Triple doubles, two bricks and tech squeeze
Triple doubles, two hoes and check please 
They love me on my Ric Flair shit 
In that Phantom like I'm Blair Witch 
Who are you to be compared with? 
Ain't no niggas that you bled with
Court cases ran base and road aces
Lick shots or left bodies with no traces
Yuugh! This the life that we made
Gun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade

Feds takin' pictures like it's GQ 
This Avianne collarbone is see-through
Angel on my shoulder, ""What should we do?"" 
Devil on the other, ""What would Meek do?""
Pop a wheelie, tell the judge to Akinyele
Middle fingers out the Ghost, screamin' ""Makaveli"" 
Hail Mary, the scale fairy
Two sides to every coin so we bail ready

Murder on the highway, the news is at six
See, I did it my way, the proof's in the bricks

Two can get you four like a double dare

You gotta watch who you callin' crazy
Yeezy, the newest billion-dollar baby

So it's only one king that can stand on this mound

Whether rappin' or I'm rappin' to a whore
Might reach back and relapse to wrappin' up this raw

Twenty-five bricks, move work like chore
Hit Delaware twice, needed twenty-five more
I see flaw, cracks in your diamond
CB4
when you rhyme, Simple Simon
Come and meet the pieman,
a must that I flaunt it
The legend grows legs when it comes back to haunt us
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards 
Can't a bitch livin' say I bought her Michael Kors 
Every car driven was decided by the horse
Keep the sticker in the window 'case you wonder what it cost
How could you relate when you ain't never been great?
And rely on rap money to keep food up on your plates, nigga?
I might sell a brick on my birthday
Thirty-six years of doin' dirt like it's Earth Day—God!

I gotta change my ways
Might as well start to watch what I say
I grew up a bad example
Lately I can't smoke where I lay
I don't wanna set bad examples
All good, ain't no smoke with my lady
We at peace in the house burning sages
She just walking around saying prayers
In a few months, you'll be here in April
Brand new room for you, right now we making it
Even though I know you'll never stay in it
On the 48th floor where we staying at, that's just my lil' way of saying we making it
Daddy still gotta go hard to stay with it
Family all out of harm's way, we safe with it
Don't spend no more, lock the safe up, we saving it
Just so you straight, ain't it
I give you all that I can
Teach you all of the things that I learned on my own, but they minee me a man
You ain't gotta grow up in the streets like I did, I lost the bestest of friends
I did make sacrifices for them
I did everything for everybody but myself and I felt like less of a man
Ain't gotta tote gats on Essex again
Lord sent a blessing, amen
Mama ain't stressing, amen
Put family first as long they do the best that they can
Just watch for the snakes, everybody that hate, wanna smile in yo face and watch what you make
Just 'cause you born great, in the womb eating steak
Car seats in the Wraith and estates
Yeah, I bought yo mama a Range, 90K
I bought my mama a Benz, 60K
Just got pulled over in that Bentley today
Police trying to talk to me, ain't nothing to say, ay
I was just brought up that way
My dad taught me that at a very young age
Say, I want my lawyer today
Say, I want my father today 
Everyday saw my Dad I was still on that A
Rebelled on my father, dived in that water
He
instilled fear in me everyday
The more older I got, the less I did what he say
Ain't trying to teach you that way
I ain't trying to beat you I ain't, I'm gonna give you the game
Can't wait to see your lil face and meet you
I love you, you came from the blood of my vein
Give you food out my belly, clothes off my back
Plan your whole future I spend every stack
Hustle to get every bag, hustler, when you of age I'll tell you 'bout that

Just so you can understand my life
I got tired of wrong and started doing what's right
Ain't no more pouring codeine in my sprite
And now I'm just up until 6 every night
No question, for you I'ma ride
Play with my kid, homicide
All that bullshit to the side
I'ma be there 'til I die
And when I die, I'ma still be right there with you, just hold your head to the sky
All you see red in mine
But it won't be no pain in your eyes
That's why I'm here to wash away your cries
G-Fazos in every size
My lil niggas swag gotta match mine
Baby, rollie time if I'm shining, then you shine
Daddy on the grind, ain't gon be there all the time
Make your Momma happy, I don't see mine all the time
Things people say I don't believe all the time
That's cause someone using me all the time
Only people I put my trust in is mine
Only people I'm stuck with is mine
And I only got money for mine
It ain't too much my money can't buy
My limit's the sky, this like a letter to mine
You ain't gotta come up and make all those stupid decisions like I
Ain't gotta thug to survive
I sold drugs to survive
Hurt some of my love ones, I lied
Me and my big cousin is fine
Still holding grudges in mind
Life too short son, just take your losses and ride
Life super short, son I'm just happy I'm alive
Yeah
It's crazy man, I'm finna have my first born son
You know we only raise young kings and queens, ya know what I'm saying
Gotta bring my son up how I was raised even better times 10
This for everybody trying to stay focused
Do you to provide for your family, ya know
Like I'm trying to do this for my family
Cause nothing gon' come from my family
I’ll lay down right now and die for  my son and I ain't even ever met him
I'm out here ya know, protecting my girl, my girl can't even go to the grocery store right now while she pregnant
She can't fuck, she can't do nothing right now she pregnant"

I wanna leave the street, but I can't lie, that's who raised me
I ain't tell my daughter I been losin' my patience
Tryna go to Heaven, but my car, it came from Satan 

In '22, I had a baby
I'm chasin' M&Ms, but I ain't tryna get Slim Shady
These niggas was feminine so I'm just tryna see who raised 'em
I swear my life was hard, this shit was harder than thе pavement
Yeah, had to sleep in cars, swеar I did that shit for days, huh
Robbin' everybody like this shit run in my veins, yeah
I can be the bank, but Hunxho still'll never change, yeah
I went paid bond before I ever bought a chain
Street nigga, bought a 'Cat, but I ain't get it in my name, yeah
These boys like Godzilla, name bigger than my gang
They flippin' any car, so ain't no swervin' in my lane
Tried to give me seven years, but I can't serve it, that's a shame

You don't trust 'em, gotta play 'em close
It be the ones you love the most
We gun shit like Rambo, Lord, Lord, Lord
I ain't talkin' 'bout Shaq shoe, that shit that I stand on
I put this on my grandma, Lord, Lord, Lord
Hard times made me
I wanna leave the street, but I can't lie, that's who raised me
I ain't tell my daughter I been losin' my patience
Tryna go to Heaven, but my car, it came from Satan

Hellcats and Demons
Check on the smoke and they say everything okay with us
Last night I talked to God, he told me I don't pray enough
And fuck them fake friends, I don't feel they real as us
Didn't hold me down, they tried they best to try to hold me up
I seen this before, I think I'm workin' on my third life
Drive that Lambo how I want, I just took it through the red light
I come out that gutter where it ain't no love at
Where niggas kill they homies that they growed up with
But never killed an opp, that's just some shit I don't get
Nigga tried to up on Wop, got hit up with his own blick
If it ain't on me, it's close to me, I know niggas'll snake me
Get my homie back for these diamonds, I promise I'll take it
Brand new foreigns all through the hood to see my auntie
Know she love to see me shinin', yeah, yeah
Damn near gave up on that same block, can you blame me?
Is I'm livin' or dyin'? Yeah, yeah
You don't trust 'em, gotta play 'em close
It be the ones you love the most
We gun shit like Rambo, Lord, Lord, Lord
I ain't talkin' 'bout Shaq shoe, that shit that I stand on
I put this on my grandma, Lord, Lord, Lord

Fuckin up in school and he stay in n outta juvenile
Momma see him on the news but she can't believe it cause he his momma child
Drop down to his knees about a hunnit times
And he was taught the right way
He got the chance and took the other side
He wake up think n pray
Then say he straight {?} ain't a homicide
Stressin bout the bills, he feel like damn he gotta help out
Had to step up at a young age cause his pops decide to step out
Angеr in his body, seen his brother body stretched out
Hе thinking bout the killing, he know how to
And you ain't gotta be no quarter back to see just what he going through
{?}, see what that firearm do
He by his self
He don't fuck wit niggas
And that shit crazy cause mom dukes ain't even fuckin wit em
And he went {?} in the county so lil bro read the {?} every night
He gotta baby, see his son every night
And his baby momma down for em
She ain't trippin, spray a whole hunnid round for em
And {?} know he goin through it
She was cryin for em
Know he wanna slide onna opps
She been fuckin wit em so she got the drop
Time to hit his manz up
Time to get his hands dirty
Gave his manz the drac
He gon rock out wit his manz .30
Told him pull up on the east side
And he got the g ride
Draco in his coat
And he geek up outta dope
He don't give no fucks
Hop inside the car, soon as his manz pulled up
Gloves on, coat on, and his manz rolled up
Pulled up to the opps spot
Nine time post up
They guns in  the air, this for my brother nigga toe suck
Black car pulled up, hopped out wit a bag on em
Both his pockets full so they know he got some cash on em
Trigger finger twitching, his man ready to smash on em
Soon he hit the door they on his ass like some pants on em
Guns on em, stripped him butt naked, it ain't nun on em
Lil bro took gloves and his mask off ain't nun em
Flip the script and put the gun on his manz he tried to run from em
Hit his manz inna back, his manz drop he took the gun from em
Blood all in his manz eyes like where the love go
Ain't no love when you fuck my baby momma, nigga gun smoke
Turn around tryna to hit the opp the opp got guns tho
He already knew it was over, gun smoke"

And I know it's gon' be hard for you to just move on
But just move on, 'cause I ain't the nigga for you, I'm the one you want
But I can't be the man you need, that shit hurt to watch you leave
Sorry, gotta let you go 'cause, girl, you not the one for me

I know that I hurt your heart, I ripped your lil' shit apart
I took all the love you gave for granted, selfishly, I thought
Wish I could just press rewind and this just wasn't perfect timing
If I could just take it all back, I probably would, I promise

If I could just take that shit back, I promise you I'd take that shit back

Gunna,Drip Too Hard by Lil Baby & Gunna,"
Run that back, Turbo

You can get the biggest Chanel bag in the store if you want it
I gave 'em the drip, they sucked it up, I got 'em moanin'
I bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned 'em
Takin' these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the mornin'
That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it
If I'm in the club, I got that fire when I'm performin'
The backend just came in, in all hundreds
Vibes galore, cute shit, they all on us
I'm from Atlanta where young niggas run shit
I know they hatin' on me, but I don't read comments
Whenever I tell her to come, she comin'
Whenever it's smoke, we ain't runnin'

Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made

Yeah, every other night, another dollar gettin' made
Every other night started with a good day
I feel like a child, I got boogers in the face
Diamonds dancin' in the dial like this shit is a parade
I don't want your chain, Young GonWunna not a slave
I had to draw the line, too many bitches gettin' saved
TSA harass me, so I took a private plane
These pussy niggas lackin', why I'm workin' on my aim
Drip too hard , charge it to the card 
Designer to the ground, I can barely spell the names
Drip too hard, caution on the floor
You gon' fuck around and drown tryna ride a nigga wave
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise

She gave me her number, now I gotta block it
I'm mixin' the dirty bills in with the profit
Clean that shit up and I give it right back to him
If I don't fuck with him, then I can't rap with him
I wanna be there when somebody catches him
I want a witness to see that shit
Man, these folks, these folks gotta goddamn hear this shit, no cap
I bring up hits and they change up the topic

They wanted to stop it, but they couldn't stop it
You told a story like shorty was feelin' you
She told a story like she split the bill with you
Look at my story, man, no one could write it
Now I see a million, I don't get excited
I might just YSL my shit, the Thugger way
Ain't no real sense in me goin' the other way
Cannot be seen in that shit from the other day
Virgil just chef'd me a whole different colorway
Please don't be stupid, it's Baby and Gunna
And Baby, he wanted her, so I just swung her
Next time I'm in Dallas, I'll look for another
You niggas fell off and you'll never recover

Poured up some Hi-Tech and wait 'til it bubble
Young Gunna Gunna, I make this shit double
Hit Eliantte and left with a puddle
It's me, Drake, and Baby, you know you in trouble

Sign plus an M, bought a Benz for my brother
Painted all black, the interior butter
I drip like a leak and that's word to my mother
Yeah, came out the street, gotta sleep with a cutter
Family a beast, we gon' eat us a supper
My dick in her mouth like she teethin' or somethin'
Sound like it could be Drip Season this summer
Ain't no comparin' 'cause we number one
In black and white Chanel, I look like a nun
The police in shock, don't know who got a gun
Don't got what I got 'cause I shop in Milan
It's winter, I still took the top off the don
The kid was surprised that my trunk in the front
I know you a upset they don't shine in the sun
Cuban link look like a box of crayons
I'm still at the lot, tryna cop the Cayenne
I told the judge, ""Fuck it"", I'm goin' on the run
You want it, my dawgs'll look out for the bond

And I'm gettin' by, let 'em choose sides

Spend a whole hundred on a new wristwatch
Don't gotta drip, I can leave it to Gunna
Runnin' this shit, only been out two summers
That 4x4 truck, I post 300

Ain't got no feelings, I'm here for the money
Treat every club like a Magic on Monday
Niggas ain't rich for real, they gettin' fronted
Gave her a dime, told her fix up her stomach
By the time she get back, I'ma switch up my number
Cap to her friend like I been on her bumper
Lately, I been the topic of discussion
Draco was foreign, they shipped it from Russia
Bad vibes at my show like I'm Usher
If she tell me ""No"" once, I won't even touch it
All I do is get her out here, abortion
Act like I've been rich, I used to have nothin'
Drizzy hit me up like he got another one
Money ain't even came in from the other one
Fuck it, I'm hot, so I might as well double up
Seem like everything I get on a number one
They tryna team up to beat me, they huddlin' up
Ever catch me out in traffic, I'm cuttin' up
Every city we go to, it be lit as fuck

Twenty racks don't feel like nothin' to me
Came from the streets, it turned me to a beast
Invisible set, diamonds huggin' my piece
Book me for a show, I need eighty at least
I want the smoke, ain't no keepin' the peace
Keep me a razor when I'm in the East
Open 'em up just like a surgery
Everything burnin' around me, I'm lit
Show a lil' attitude, swap out the bitch
I spent two-fifty, don't know where it went
My hood on my back, I gotta represent
Toronto, you useless, you don't got a pole
Warm that boy up, he got shot in the cold
Thirty rounds in the clip, let it unload
I fuck the bitch I picked right out of Vogue

Took twenty bitches on my first vacay
I ain't pickin' up, I'm in Turks, lil' baby
Every other watch got diamonds in the face
Pullin' out, ask to take a taste, lil' baby
Pullin' out fifty racks, walkin' out of Chase
If I drop dead, I'll be hard to replace
Hardly get thirsty, got water like a lake
My brother got locked, another bond I gotta pay

Trappin' on the block, I'd never serve a cop
I always kept a Glock, I ain't 'bout to see the grave 
Pull up, I'll make a quick stop 
I shop one stop, I'm high for seven days 
Who is that lil' nigga icy hoppin' out a Wraith? 
Chopper get it choppin' like a blade 
You ain't get no money but you poppin' on your page 
Trust me, we could never be the same 
You know I like to flirt, no skirts in Turks 
I'm puttin' in work, I beat her out the frame 
She sweet, I was movin' off a Perc'
I bought her a Birk' and a birthday cake 
Line his ass up like a barber do the fade 
Fed your ho crêpes and grapes
Cash told me, ""Wait, it's a billion on the way"" 
We just split a billi' with the gang
Took twenty bitches on my first vacay
I ain't pickin' up, I'm in Turks, lil' baby
Every other watch got diamonds in the face
Pullin' out, ask to take a taste, lil' baby
Pullin' out fifty racks, walkin' out of Chase
If I drop dead, I'll be hard to replace
Hardly get thirsty, got water like a lake
My brother got locked, another bond I gotta pay

First time in Turks, had a whole bunch of work
Had to bring two jets, had a whole lot of babes 
I first take a game-changin' verse
Swear the change gon' hurt, but it really ain't a game 
Shawty like to twerk, I bring the rage 
Really get to trippin' on the stage
Never ever let 'em see the man unless they pay  
Niggas havin' beef, I hope they pray
Cactus Jack me up and down, head to toe
Make sure the ones you with on go
Make sure the ones you with is with it
Make sure the ones you with, ah 
She need a quick tan, come to Turks with the G's 
Work for that body, need more than degrees
Fillin' her nose with some shit I can ski with
Say this her first time, it's hard to believe
Took twenty bitches on my first vacay
I ain't pickin' up, I'm in Turks, lil' baby
Every other watch got diamonds in the face
Pullin' out, ask to take a taste, lil' baby
Pullin' out fifty racks, walkin' out of Chase
If I drop dead, I'll be hard to replace
Hardly get thirsty, got water like a lake
My brother got locked, another bond I gotta pay"

Pull up with a stick, I pull up with a stick

I'll pull up with a pink toe, I'm whippin', she suckin' this dick 
I put some diamonds on her toes, let that ho know that I'm rich
We was used to pullin' kick doors 

I've been gettin' it since a toddler, I keep dollars on my head
Bein' a real one is my motto, handle my problems, I ain't scared
I put Prada on my collar 'cause she proud of what I said
I'm a leader, I got 'em followin' my footsteps like the feds
I shoot like I'm Montana, chopper bullets make 'em shed, uh
Black on black new Phantom, in the backseat sippin' red, uh
Bitch, I'm from Atlanta where these hoes ride the dick like peg, yeah
Condo like the pharmacy, I got codeine in my fridge, pour up

My bro on a steamin' stove, cookin' crack like grits
Got this vibe on her tippy toes, strokin' her in a pent'
LA live, I'm stayin' at the Loews with this Hollywood bitch
Got a nine and a snubnose , can't wait to let it hit 
Pull up with a stick, I'll pull up with a stick
I'll pull up with a pink toe, I'm whippin', she suckin' this dick
I'll put some diamonds on her toes, let that ho know that I'm rich 
We was used to pullin' kick doors, you could still call it a lick 
You broke and can't be fixed ,
went to Neimans and spent a nick 
How you poor? That don't make sense , I made a whole mile off an inch 
I had ninety-nine problems, I just scratched your ho off the list 
Got some millions and went and solved 'em, now my neck cost a quarter brick 

I've been gettin' it since a toddler, I keep dollars on my head
Bein' a real one is my motto, handle my problems, I ain't scared
I put Prada on my collar 'cause she proud of what I said
I'm a leader, I got 'em followin' my footsteps like the feds

Bitch, I'm from Atlanta where these hoes ride the dick like peg, yeah
Condo like the pharmacy, I got codeine in my fridge, pour up

Bestie, bestie, I just hit my friend
Told her ""Catch me"" , ""Catch me"" , I'ma lick her skin
She so precious, precious, might not fuck again
She too messy, messy, but hittin', no flexin' 
Rose gold ornaments 
Dropped the two tint, car came with no tint 
You don't gotta use the door, you can hop in front of tip
Bond 9 in the vent
, think 'bout dyin' and get spent
I got two B's on my boxers
and a thottie in the bed 
I know niggas ran up a milli', still didn't tell 12 shit 
I got skeletons in my closets , and they scared of me and shit 
Maison Margielas under the bed screamin', ""Rock me, kid"" 
I put water on my head, then she got seasick 
Couple opps played dead , and they still got hit
I done bent lil' mama's spine but that still ain't my kid 
Only reason I answer my line , is 'cause she drink my spit 
I've been gettin' it since a toddler, I keep dollars on my head
Bein' a real one is my motto, handle my problems, I ain't scared
I put Prada on my collar 'cause she proud of what I said

Mama said she saw me on Jimmy Kimmel 
Count it up, 'cause I'm a money symbol

I look like half a million worth of heroin when she look at me
But you ain't gotta fuck with me, my nig, but you're stuck with me
But how you called the cops on me, my nig? You grew up with me

I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high

Yeah, I had a drink, yeah, I smoked
Yeah, you think I need you but I don't
Just left out Dubai with all my folk
Open water, my location is remote
Shout-out Yachty but this ain't a lil' boat
This some shit I wrote about when I was broke
See, the power of the mind is not a joke
Man, I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get left-overs out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived
'Til I got it jumping at the crib
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean

I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high

Than to get down in a hole
Champions, we run the city
Number one, they fallin' from the top
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round it go
'Round and 'round they go
I'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole

The ladies love luxury 
That's why they all fuck with me 
Out here with the moves  like I invented smooth
You can't tell me I ain't fly 
I know I'm super fly , I know I'm super fly

Huh, huh, huh

All my diamonds custom so they clutchin' and they touchin' on me
Ooh, think it's vegetables
Ooh, think it's edible

Section full of fine dimes
Bitches starin' at me sayin', ""Wow""

All these diamonds got me sick, I'm actin' spoiled 
Cutlass sittin' high , I feel like I can fly 
So fresh to death, it's crazy, feel like I can die

Gucci Mane,Make Love by Gucci Mane & Nicki Minaj,"
Uh, Gucci
Wanna make love, love, love

King of the skreets
And when these suckas see me, they should bow to my feet
And kiss the ground underneath
I look down at the beef
That shit childish to me
Two hundred thousand to see me
And it's been sold out for weeks
Can't brush shoulders with me
These stones in my choker are 2 karats apiece
Look like boulders to me
Damn, who colder than me?
You think he colder than me?
You more bipolar than me
You talkin' crazy
I'm tryna book Beyoncé for my wedding day
I'm the type of nigga, spend a million on a wedding cake
Niggas hate, but hesitate
They hate to see ya elevate
I just left out the gym
I'm 'bout to take a swim and meditate
Woo!
Now it's time to celebrate
Ask me why I'm smilin'
I say, ""'Cause I make two mil' a day""
And I might take your bitch and pay her bills
That's how I feel today
And I just wanna fuck
Don't wanna chill, that's how I feel today

I'm makin' money like I'm makin' sweet love
I wanna make love, love, love
She say the money make her wanna make love
Wanna make love, love, love, huh

Ay yo, ain't talkin' housewives, but I'm in the Porsche
First I'ma scorch her, then I'ma torch her
Then I'ma torture her, then I'ma off her
A million dollars for a show, they made their off-er
Go against Nicki, it's gon' cost ya
'Cause now it's fuck ya, intercourse ya
I rep Queens where they listen to a bunch of Nas
I'm a yes and these bitches is a bunch of nahs
Tryin’ to win a gunfight with a bunch of knives
I win, get off the bench and give a bunch of fives
I don't see her
Bitch I'm the greatest, no Kendrick and no Sia
I'm the iPhone, you the Nokia
Everybody know you jealous, bitch it's so clear
Tell them bum ass bitches to play their role
She see my sexy ass every time she scroll
I got it in the can, Dole
Your career gon' be with Anna Nicole
Witcha dumbass face
She ain't eatin' but I swear she got some bum ass taste
Text her man like, ""Dawg, how that bum ass taste?""
Pay your rent! And stay in your bum ass place
Oooohhh, oh you the qu-e-e-the queen of this here?
One platinum plaque, album flopped, bitch, where? 
Hahaha, ahhhhh
I took two bars off just to laugh
You see, silly rabbit, to be the queen of rap
You gotta sell records, you gotta get plaques
S, plural like the S on my chest
Now sit your dumbass down
You got an F on your test
I'm makin' money like I'm makin' sweet love
I wanna make love, love, love
She say the money make her wanna make love
Wanna make love, love, love, huh

Walkin' in the club and they like, ""Gucci just arrived""

She look like a model, but a devil in disguise

So much money in the air, can't even see the sofa
So much kush smoke in the air, I can't help but smell the odor

Half a pint in the Mountain Dew, now that's a dirty soda
And— And I sell so many chickens, think I work for Kroger

Ayy, bad yellow bitch, passin' unless she a rider 
She is down to ride with me and she gon' hold my Glocky

Who want smoke with me? I'm tryna fuck a nigga lungs up
They be like, ""Nardo, put them damn guns up""
Fuck that, say, ""Big brother, bring them guns out""
When it's smoke, we get to spinnin' while the sun out
I ain't never lackin', I pump gas with my gun out
Scream out, ""What's happenin'?"" then get to bussin' 'til it run out
All these niggas hidin', I'm likе where they at? It ain't no fun now
7.62s big as hеll'll knock a nigga lungs out
One, two, three, four 
Five, six, seven, eight 
Nine, ten, eleven, we ain't gon' say that number, we don't fuck with jakes
I'ma kill fourteen niggas if thirteen bitch niggas play
I think my Draco might be gay , 'cause he blow niggas
I just got a brand new Lolli, that's a four-nickel
Call me Nardo yes-man, I don't know niggas
You can send your best man, you gon' lose your best hitter

What the fuck is that?
What the fuck is that?
That's how I step on niggas


We step on shit like Craig daddy
We in the gym, no pep rally
Won't come outside, he scared probably
They deeper than a fuckin' party
That don't matter 
'Cause I'm gon' spray this bitch at everybody
I'm Nardo, bitch, I do magic
Turn his whip into a basket
Take his life, he shouldn't have had it
I'm quick to snap just like my daddy
My nina rules, she kinda sassy
Let her go, she'll let you have it
Play you, lay you, try you down
I'm cold as hell, but I let off fire
Please don't try 'cause you gon' die
And I don't wanna see your mama cry
Who want smoke with me?
Who want smoke with me?
Nigga, who want smoke with me?
Who want smoke with me?
Who want smoke with me?
Who want smoke with me?
Nigga, who want smoke with me?

What the fuck is that?
What the fuck is that?
That's how I step on niggas

Ice water, turned Atlantic 
Nightcrawlin' in the Phantom 
Told them hoes that don't you panic
Took an island,  flood the mansion 
Dropped the roof, more expansion
Drive a coupe you can stand in 
See the bitches undercover 
I'm an ass and titty lover 
Guess we all made for each other
Now that all the dawgs free 
And we out in these streets 
Can you do it, can you pop it for me?

Pull up in a Demon, on God

Fuck her on a yacht, dive in a pool 
She an addict , addict for the lifestyle and the Patek 
Big daddy, have you ever felt Chanel fabrics? 
I be drippin' to death, I need a casket 
And we got more stripes than the ref, he foul, TEC him 
In the middle of the field like David Beckham 
All my niggas locked up, for real, I'm tryna help 'em 
When I got a mil', got me the chills, don't know what happened 
Pop pills, do what you feel, I'm on that zombie 
I'm more like Gaddafi, I'm not no Gandhi 
I'm more like I'm David, Goliath runnin'

I'm slidin' in a coupe, ain't got no key to start
I got the fire on me in BET Awards
When your well run dry, you know you need me for it
When I pull up in the Buick, you know what I'm doin'
If the police get behind me, I'm fleein' and eludin'
Sleepin' on the palette turned me to a savage
I'm a project baby, now I stay in Calabasas
Like I still serve fiends, like I'm still jackin'

Hit that Z-Walk, Dickie's with my Reeboks

Here, take a tissue, don't like you cryin'
I wouldn't cheat bae, you're just too perfect
I cannot lose you, it's just not worth it
I know they tweeting, them hoes is cappin'
I thought I told you ain't nothing happen
I never want you to sit there clueless
Baby, I love you, I thought you knew this
Stop gettin' angry, stop all the madness
We meant to be, look how long we lasted
Sadness, I ain't eat in days like I'm fastin'
Blasted, I wanna be with you 'til my casket
I'm just disappointed in your actions
Then you get upset at my reactions
To be honest, babe, I'm just passin'
We were doing straight and now we're slanted

I want you in my life, girl, fuck a solo
The arguments and fights, I can't do it no more
You asked am I alright and I really don't know
You said I can be replaced, baby, that's a low blow
I want you in my life girl fuck a solo
The arguments and fights, I can't do it no more
You asked am I alright and I really don't know
You said I can be replaced, baby, that's a low blow

Baby, I understand your mental, I need you to know
I got work to get done, I got the shows on the road
Secure the bag so we can take a trip to Italy
I know I’m a pain so I’m confused to why you into me
I guess this is love and I’m certain that it is
I see you got baby fever, one day we should have some kids
We in love, why we fighting? We just need to face it
It’s a marathon, you last longer when you pace it
I just want you to kno-o-ow I just want us to gro-o-ow
When we be fightin’ I feel so low, though
Are we gon’ last? I don’t know no more, I don’t know no more
Put your foot on the gas, fuck a stop sign, go 
I think we thinking too much, let’s just go with the flow

I want you in my life girl fuck a solo
The arguments and fights, I can't do it no more
You asked am I alright and I really don't know
You said I can be replaced, baby, that's a low blow 
Last verse was before the breakup
Still wondering if we gon' make up
Can't sleep girl, nah, I gotta stay up
I miss the nights when we used to cake up
Used to text ""good morning,"" now I get a ""GM""
Washed up rappers in your fuckin’ DM
Still wondering if you went to see him
Stayed out 'til the morning, after fuckin' PM
You got back in the morning, I'm talkin' 6 in the morning
Our connection got boring
You gon’ make me glo up and go and cop me a foreign
You been sleepin’ on me lately, girl, it sound like you snoring 
Used to be my baby, now I call you my ex
Them basketball players only want you for sex
Them internet niggas look at you as a check
Girl, I loved your ass to death, treated you with respect
Took you to the islands, girl, that came from the heart
I ain't really feel the love, I was doing my part
It's to much its  a whole list of shit, I don't know where to start
Go and find another man, girl, you cute and you smart"

Ballin' since I was a jit
Way before Oakland and filmin' the skits
I had a goal to get rich
Mama was strugglin' payin' the rent
I couldn't help her with shit
Hate that I'm feelin' so stuck in this bitch 
Car broke down, can't fix that shit
I cried at night, I'll admit that shit
'02 old, I'll whip that bitch
She left me 'lone but I miss that bitch
If she text right now, I'll hit that bitch
Old friends like, ""How you get that lit?""
Same old me but they think I switched
Fuck old friends, I don't know that bitch
Racks too big, can't fold that shit
I ain't get none when I owed that shit
Mama, I told you we gon' be okay
Whippin' the Benz and she live in L.A.
Tryna thank God, but don't know what to say

Don't call that lil' ass place no estate
Unless it came with a pool and a gate
Check the rear before I pull in the gate
All my watches flooded just like a lake
Lately I've been showing up extra late
Rich nigga take her on a cheap date
4 for 4 Wendy's get her a plate
Love when these nuts all up in her face
She say ""Wow, never met a nigga with dick and a house""
Spit in her mouth, diggin' her out
With a choppa in the couch for a rat or a mouse, uh

Mm, I feel like Michael Jackson
Moonwalkin' through the Calabasas
Louis bag, gotta hold the ratchet
Just in case a nigga want some action
Mm, got some millions, but it's just a fraction
Spendin' money for my satisfaction
Benjamins, we don't fuck with Jacksons

Bet when I drop, they don't post that shit 
All good though, I'ma note that shit
When I blow, you'll owe me, bitch
Humble-ass nigga but I know I'm rich 
Fuck that shit, I know I'm lit
If we beef, I'll fuck your bitch
All of the niggas I beef on the internet
I hit up all of they bitches and get 'em wet
Call her a Uber, I hit 'em and send 'em back
Do it in silence cause players ain't into that
No, oh, I hit his bitch on the low, oh
She said your dick game was so-so
And she had told me you broke, oh
,
that's tough
That's tough, that's tough
Blueface and DDG, hoes at the BnB
Watching a DVD, giving her
DVD
2020 Wagon, A-B-C-D-F-G
Get too close, it go beep-beep-beep-beep-beep
Road Runner, all he heard was meep-meep-meep
Nyoom, seven-fifty in the horse
Hopped off the porch and I crashed the Porsche
Hop out the bed and I smash the whore
Knock-knock, guess who's at the door
Oops, forgot I ordered that Dior 
Came in straight from Europe 

Spent four hunnid on beanies easy
She want dick, she needy, freaky, I like Wraiths, no Lamborghini
She off X, she sleepy-sleepy, yeah
Make me a wish, no genie-genie, vanish on niggas just like Houdini

Mm, I feel like Michael Jackson
Moonwalkin' through the Calabasas

Listen

Went to Texas for a few days
Wanted to scout out the properties
Lookin' like I won a lottery
None of the hate really bother me
YouTube three years, they don't wanna see me blow
They don't wanna hear the flow
But this usually how it go
Bankroll, bankroll
The bank tellers know my name
My life now not the same
I got money with the fame
PayPal with the transfer, brought my momma straight to tears
Get her a 'Rari to steer, she ain't pay rent in years
Couldn't park at the store, I got butterfly doors
One space, need more
Somebody rally the score
My music is hot, bitch nigga give me my credit
Sending shots without a medic
Four bands from my edits
My exes, ""Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha"" they regret it, heh
Yeah nigga, I said it, mm
Two hunnid bands on my debit, mm
Got enough education, I'm a college dropout, heh
Same nigga that'll doubt be the main one beggin' for my clout

Yeah
I mean these niggas just, you know, they don't understand what I been through man, and, you know?
I do all this shit on my own, my nigga, you know what I'm sayin'?And I'm just out here tryin' to get respect, but at the same time it's like, ""Fuck you,"" you know what I'm sayin'? But, I guess its just me, ventin' right now
It's whatever though
Yeah

Why you rap about the money? I ain't never had shit
Told myself, ""Don't quit, watch how you get rich""
Niggas see me in Pontiac they 'on't never ever wanna speak
Sent a text, ""Let's meet,"" nigga, I been here for weeks
I'on't usually like, go home 'cause I know niggas hate a lot
I'd probably get shot, and we don't even got cops
Cold case on my big bro, but we all know who did it
10K we'll split it, guarantee they won't miss it
Niggas really used to struggle, mama really had to hustle
Two jobs had to juggle, we'll be good, now I'm humble
Private client at the chase, I got a personal banker
Ksubi jeans on my ass, used to be at Walmart buying Wrangler
Gas station 2am, bought some Hershey's out the wrapper
Don't compare me to a rapper, I make more than a rapper
Go to school for 4 years, 50K be a salary
I just made 50K in a week, take a pic for my gallery

I don't really be tryna stunt on anybody but its just like, you gotta understand when you come from nothin' you know, you gotta have something to show for it, man, you know what I'm sayin'? Where I come from, niggas ain't too successful, you know?
So, I like to show what I got
50K in a week, nigga, no bullsh', just sayin'
Yeah
Check neck, check wrist
Date just with the Cubans
100K on the ice, So I'm cautious when I'm movin'
I don't go to the club, pussy is not that important
Threw my contact sortin', I got hoes out in Portland
I notice, we don't talk too often
You gon' claim we was best friends when I'm dead and gone in my coffin
I don't hang around you niggas, now you probably know the reasons
I be chillin' by myself out the way tryna get through the seasons
Niggas think I'm a goofy, let me make a little statement
Don't come at me reckless, them videos for entertainment
I did the shit on my own, I got the check on my own
Bitch, I'm flyer than a drone, so you better watch your tone
10K for a feature, I had to get off the bleachers
Why the fuck would you stay in school when you makin' more than a teacher?
Nigga I did it, I did it, I owe God all the glory
Could've been dead and broke but you know they don't wanna hear my story

Yeah
Man, I just wanna say, you know, I'ma continue to do what I do, man
You know what I'm sayin', I'm not gon' let these...these no good ass niggas, you know what I'm sayin', try and break me down and, you know what I'm sayin', tell me I'm not good enough, you know what I'm sayin', but, I'ma just let this music take off and let it speak for itself, you know?

I'ma just fly her ass out of the country
And play with the kitty, but never gon' cuff you
Five star meals when I eat these days, my homie just told me I'm bougie
Friday night's in the L.A lights, let's make a fuckin' movie

I do not play by the rules, they can not slow me down
They see that I'm makin' moves, wan' be my homie now
Shawty is datin' ole dude, but she wanna blow me now
Don't tell me what you gon' do, you gotta show me now

I'm in the city with biddies, they showin' they titties, they fuckin' with me
Pull up to Dyckman, Dominican shorties, be really be lookin' O.D
Moncler coat in the NYC with a P.Y.T. and she all on me
Cartier shades and it's dark outside, but I only got 'em on 'cause I'm high O.D
Get that gas and I roll that gas, and I hit that gas, now I'm high so fast
Rolls Royce Wraith with a V-12 engine, If I hit that gas, I'ma swerve right pass
Young rich nigga, I don't take no shit
I'll beat a nigga ass 'cause I ain't no bitch
Ain't no cap this is real life nigga, 'cause it ain't no script and it ain't no skit
Flex O.D. 'cause I made me a milli' and I did it own my own, and my childhood rough
Bad bitch with me and she off that stuff, by twelve I'ma fuck, if she cuff, that's tough
You think you know but you really don't know, I had to choose the right path I would go
Could've sold drugs 'cause I really was poor, but I was smart, man, I know how that go

I do not play by the rules, they can not slow me down
They see that I'm makin' moves, wan' be my homie now
Shawty is datin' ole dude, but she wanna blow me now
Don't tell me what you gon' do, you gotta show me now

I'm in the city with biddies, they showin' they titties, they fuckin' with me
Pull up to Dyckman, Dominican shorties, be really be lookin' O.D
Moncler coat in the NYC with a P.Y.T. and she all on me
Cartier shades and it's dark outside, but I only got 'em on 'cause I'm high O.D"
DDG,OD by DDG,"
Yeah
Ktwice on the beat

Landed fresh on the city I'm stuck in baggage
Tunnel vision for money, I'm doing damage
Using all of my struggles to my advantage
But this hate that I'm getting is slowly making me savage
Getting sick and I'm traveling coast to coast
I got money I'm valid enough to boast
Breadwinner my pockets is stuffed with toast
I don't know you little nigga don't tag me in what you post

These girls don't want me for me
They just finesse on the clout
These niggas don't support me
I make a move and they doubt
These niggas copying me
I call these niggas my clones
These niggas hatin' on me
Gotta do this on my own

They ask me why I don't talk
I just sit back and observe
And I done blew up so quick
I just kept straight while you curve
It's back to back like ping pong
I know my ex vibe to my song
I been in love for too long
Why they keep doing me wrong
These days love do not exist
Niggas not faithful and girls don't commit
So we go clubbing and be drinking and shit
Boasting on snap and it's not even lit
I'd rather have just one girl to myself
All of this drinking not good for my health
I got a sold out show on the 12th
I just be working and building my wealth 

These girls don't want me for me
They just finesse on the clout
These niggas don't support me
I make a move and they doubt
These niggas copying me
I call these niggas my clones
These niggas hatin' on me
Gotta do this on my own
Gotta do this on my own
Got to do this on my own yeah"

Woo, woo
I pull up like
How you pull up, Baby? How you pull up? 
How you pull up? I pull up 

Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop 
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? 
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock 
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me 
You better let me go the day you need me 
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' 
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop

It's safe to say I earned it, ain't a nigga gave me nothin' 
I'm ready to hop out on a nigga, get to bustin'
Know you heard me say, ""You play, you lay,"" don't make me push the button
Full of pain, dropped enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket
Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
I got a big drum, it hold a hundred, ain't goin' for nothin'
I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
Just talked to my mama, she hit me on FaceTime just to check up on me and my brother
I'm really the baby, she know that her youngest son was always guaranteed to get the money 
She know that her baby boy was always guaranteed to get the loot
She know what I do, she know 'fore I run from a nigga, I'ma pull it out and shoot 
PTSD, I'm always waking up in cold sweats like I got the flu
My daughter a G, she saw me kill a nigga in front of her before the age of two
And I'll kill another nigga too
'Fore I let another nigga do somethin' to you
Long as you know that, don't let nobody tell you different
Daddy love you 

Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop 
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? 
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock 
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me 
You better let me go the day you need me 
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' 
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop 
Keep a Glocky when I ride in the Suburban
'Cause the codeine had a young nigga swervin'
I got the mop, watch me wash 'em like detergent
And I'm ballin', that's why it's diamonds on my jersey
Slide on opps' side and flip the block back, yeah, yeah
My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
Fool me one time, you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin
Maybach SUV for my refugees
Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day
But they ain't even want no smoke
If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote

Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop 
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? 
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock 
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me 
You better let me go the day you need me 
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin'

Take 20K and put that on your head
And make one of your partners come kill you 
Say he fuckin' with me then he gotta grow up

Her boyfriend be hatin' and callin' her groupie
Just 'cause she like all my music 
She'll send me a text and then delete the message
He tryna find out, it's confusin'

Use the brain in your head 'fore you lose it 
I'll pull up after school and I'll teach her some shit
Tell your bro I'm a motherfuckin' tutor

Wheezy outta here

Yeah, rest in peace to Bankroll‚ show 'em how to do it
Baby goin' crazy‚ he been gettin' straight to it
I done caught so many flights I end up fuckin' all the stewardesses
Catch me in Atlanta‚ no security with my jewelry
Found I was rich, my baby mama talkin' suin' me
'Nother bitch tellin' lies on the pussy like she screwin' me
Catch him down bad, that's his ass‚ nigga, you or me
SI diamonds on the chain, he ain't foolin' me
We was skippin' school on the train‚ duckin' truancy
My main partner turned into a rat, he talkin' 'bout robbin' me
I pray the judge give that boy a bond so I can pop him
We was in the hood, sellin' bags, shootin' choppers
Fucked around and tried to go and lease a helicopter
Baby really a problem, somebody gotta stop him
And the haters watchin' too hard, I think they got binoculars
Every nigga with me on go, it ain't no stoppin' us
Niggas actin' like they got the bag, I'm tryna stop it up
Do this for the bros down the road, gotta lock it up
All you gotta do is say it's smoke, then we're poppin' up
Baby got the streets on hold, he ain't drop yet
I've been goin' hard, it's gon' be hard for you to top that
I make it look easy, but this shit really a process
I'm really a millionaire, still in the projects

Baby puttin' on for the city
Baby, he the realest, Baby prolly got a couple million
Baby hang with four or five killers
Baby got children, Baby prolly still drug dealin
Baby ain't a trapper, he a rapper
Baby makin' classics, Baby in the hood gettin' active
Baby keep it real with his people
Baby like a preacher,
Baby prolly still sell reefer

Huh? Baby prolly still got them
'bows
I tell my bitch I'm faithful, but I still got the hoes
Baby gettin' jiggy,
on stage with the Glizzy
Baby CEO, he shake the game like he Diddy
You would think it's Mardi Gras, I got these bitches showin' titties
And I ain't throwin' beads, I pull them bitches' weaves
I'm stallin' bitches out, if I'm a dog, then she a flea
And when I fuck her doggystyle the only time I'm on my knee
I barely wanna hit her, got her beggin', ""Baby, please""
I tell a bitch to shut up, you 'bout to fuck my nut up
The label's CEO keep beggin' me to keep the gun up
They know, you play with Baby, Baby beat him, cut up
Private plane, Wi-Fi, on the FaceTime with Johnny
I told him ice my wrist up, I like to hold my fist up
How that boy DaBaby in the air not gettin' his dick sucked?
Why he keep the fire and throw them fours in every picture?
'Cause nigga...
Baby puttin' on for the city
Baby, he the realest, Baby prolly got a couple million
Baby hang with four or five killers

Thinkin' 'bout my grandmama and shit

I got the number one record, they acknowledged the jit

They goin' crazy when they play it, head bobbin' and shit
And I'm just somewhere fucked up thinkin' 'bout my father and shit
They found him dead a couple days before I started tour
Same day I flew back to the city from Miami
I was out there with the family
Just lookin' at my daughter
Thinkin' to myself like, ""Damn, my baby look just like my daddy""
Same time I got the news, my shit went number one, that's fucked up
That shit there was confusin', a lil' bit, you know I flew in with the stick
Okay, like let me know what's up before I lose it in this bitch
And everybody tryna talk, I ain't tryna talk, I'm tryna click
I'm tryna send somebody wit' him
Somebody let me know what's happenin'
My last name K-I-R-K, Kirk
You know how I rock behind my daddy
You know I never gave a fuck about the world, just about my family
How the fuck I make it to the top same day I lost the nigga that had me?
How a nigga perform on BET and a year ago couldn't afford a sandwich?
I had to move in with TG when I went broke movin' out to Cali
What you know about smilin' every day for all your fans, actin' like you happy?
I spent a hundred thousand layin' my daddy to rest, but I ain't braggin'
I got some questions, I'm a die about respect if I don't get answers
My mama stood up in that chair, took it like a G when she had cancer
My brother be thinkin' that we don't love him and let him struggle like we ain't family
Like I won't give up all I got to see you happy, nigga
We shocked the world, everybody know what's happenin', nigga
I'm still Lil' Jon Jon, my song, it just went platinum, nigga
We on our own time, let's go move out to Cali, nigga
Put the kids in homeschool, let's go get us a mansion, nigga
Let's raise our kids right, let's watch the shit we teach 'em, nigga
Let's start a business for you so they can't say that you leechin', nigga
How I know I'm the chosen one, 'cause sometimes when I be speakin', nigga
Like on this song, I ain't rappin', I'm preachin', nigga

If I love you, then I need ya 
I fuck with you like Martin fuck with Gina 
We family like we Venus and Serena 
Let's go get married like we Thankgod and Kenisha 
Don't give a fuck about the world, just 'bout my people 
I don't care what the fuck they told you, we ain't equal 
Niggas ain't cut from the same cloth, these niggas see-through 
And I be too busy doin' me to see what he do, nigga

Yeah, verse two, that lil' nigga from the other side 
And I do it myself, whenever I ride, you know that my brothers ride 
And I still got a lotta shit on my mind that I can't undecide 
Got me ready to slide, feelin' like Doughboy when his brother died 
You know how I step, you know how I rep, you know about Baby, nigga 
You know how I'm comin' back for that cross if you ever play me, nigga 
You know how I got it up out the mud and turned it to gravy, nigga 
And hit the rap game like crack cocaine in the '80s, nigga

Fuck you niggas talkin' 'bout, bruh? Like.. 
Look 
Look, man
Look 
Baby on Baby, now that's Baby on Baby
God is great

Why you tryna keep me teeny? I
It's a dream, he wished it on a genie
I got fans finally, ain't you wantin' them to see me? I

I thought you want this for my life, for my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive, you lied

Just say to me what you want from me
Just say to me what you want from me
Baby, let's go, uh

Okay, this song right here remind me of my ex
Say I be declinin' all her calls and I don't respond to none of her texts
I be like, ""Girl, hush your mouth, you know I ain't got time for nothin' but sex""
She know I injured my right hand so when I get behind I use my left
She watched that ""Walker Texas Ranger,"" say I remind her of Nas X
I'm talkin' ""Old Town Road,"" all my hoes down low
They like girls and I like girls, three at a time, sometimes four
And if my backend not all hundreds and ain't on time, then I don't go
I be like...

Say to me what you want from me
Just say to me what you want from me
What you want?

Ayy, Panini, don't you be a meanie
Thought you wanted me to go up
Why you tryna keep me teeny now?
Now they need me, number one on streaming
Oh yeah, you used to love me
So what happened, what's the meaning? I

I thought you want this for my life, for my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive, you lied
Now when it's all done, I get the upper hand
I need a big Benz, not another fan
But I still want you as a fan
I'ma need to sit down, don't mean to make demands
But I need you to...

Say to me what you want from me
Just say to me what you want from me

Welcome to the city of Gods 
Pop was the king of New York, now I'm the nigga in charge
Only the drillers, the city is ours
We found out the opps and we pick 'em apart
I give 'em my time so I give 'em my heart
If the city love me, then I'm really a star 

New York City, please go easy on me tonight
Nеw York City, please go easy on this hеart of mine
'Cause I'm losing my lover to the arms of another
New York City, please go easy on me

Everything we do is gon' come with a challenge
Every bitch you fuck is gon' come with a balance 
Every shooter with me is coming in silence 
And you niggas better pick a side 
You niggas side hoppin' 
If I want 'em to not let you come into the city, it's my option 
This is the home of the fly shoppin' 
This where the bitches gon' watch pockets 
When I'm on TV, I gotta look good
'Cause I know the whole block watchin'
If you chill with the opps, we is not vibing
If I see 'em in person, we Fox 5 'em
Yeah, the police is on us, we not stoppin'

This is the town of the big drip , smooth talk 
Milly Rock , Shmoney Dance , Woo Walk 
You will not survive being too soft 
Been a long time, we took a new loss 
Shooters shootin' 'til we got a new corpse 
If we stop then we lettin' it cool off

It's a Sunday Service in Brooklyn 
It's the city that come with the lights
I'm with the drillers that come with the night
They ain't do four years in college, but they'll do twenty-five to life
We make money every night 
Never too big of a price 
After I buy the Chicago Bulls , I'ma go and link with Mike 
And if I let 'em have my wife, niggas should thank me
With this Balenciaga and Balenci' boots and a new blue Yankee
This is Ye, I'm so focused, throw on a mask, no COVID
I'ma turn your life to a meme, let Justin LaBoy post it
You got a album? Postpone it
I drop two and they both going
I got a feeling they in they feelings
They filmin' a show, but won't show it
You gotta watch me in slow motion, I'm in that wide-body Benz
I go back to college, do an album, and then drop out again
Took me a minute to get here, my vision is crystal clear
Ayy, Fivi', excuse me, but this the feature of the year
I feel like Sinatra in these streets, me and Drizzy, we at peace
This the backpack with the Polo and the first Jesus piece
I'm from the Chi' but I'm always New York
In the city, they treat me like Jesus is walkin'
I been through the pain and all of the torment
I'm sayin' His name, I make that important 
Now it's time to give 'em hell
Ask my staff, I pay 'em well
This afternoon, a hundred goons pullin' up to SNL 
When I pull up, it's dead on arrival
They act like they love you, they don't even like you
They throw a party, won't even invite you
I seen the same thing happen to Michael
When you black and you rich, they sayin' you psycho 
It's like a cycle
If you text me anything hype, you better text back and say it's a typo
The city of Gods, no city is like you
This the new New York, Ye is the GOAT
Fivi' is viral and this is the B.I.B.L.E 
New York City, please go easy on me tonight 
 New York City, please go easy on this heart of mine
'Cause I'm losing my lover to the arms of another

Fivio Foreign,Story Time by Fivio Foreign,"
Huh

Let me tell a little sad story about this young boy, grew up,
no pops in the crib
That nigga momma workin' so she couldn't really show him no love when he was a kid

He didn't even mean to do that incident
He was only eighteen when he  caught that bid
He in and out of jail, he ain't know how to move
He ain't know how to fight, he ain't know how to lose
He walked in the spot 
They told him, ""Strip, cough, squat"" 
The C.O. just told him that this is procedure but he knew in his mind that he was doin' a lot
He had to figure it out and then learn all the rules and then follow them, like it or not
He caught a new charge 'cause he had a little weed
Tryna sneak this shit in, it was right in his sock
Yeah, they had him in intake for like a week
They hate his guts, they think he killed police
They made it super cold with the AC
They ain't give him no blanket, they ain't give him no sheets
They put him in a cell with a dirty ass sink
He couldn't think, he couldn't sleep
They gave him no soap to wash his ass
They ain't give him no toothpaste to brush his teeth 
He ain't know why they keep botherin' him, he was kinda scared, ain't wanna argue with him
Pacin' back and forth, they keep on followin' him
Couldn't take it no more, and he finally hit him 
The C.O. done hit the button and they come and they helpin' him and run in and crack his ass
He just took a beatin' and unleashed the demon
He lookin' to grillin' and actin' bad
He ain't never been locked up before but he made up his mind
He like, ""Fuck it, if this how it start""
They couldn't count him out 'cause anybody who know lil' homie, know lil' homie got heart
He gon' adapt to his habitat, even if his habitat get dark 
He was a lil' fish when he jumped in the water
And then he grew into a shark 
Two years later , nine fights in, he found his religion
He started workin' out, takin' food, soups and respect 'cause this shit wasn't given
He wanted more for his life, he was sittin' in jail every night and his life wasn't hittin' 
And his life wasn't hittin' 
And his life wasn't, look 
Two years, he fought the case and he ain't worry 'bout it
In his mind he knew he ain't losin'
He got a paid lawyer, that's a good lawyer
And that lawyer do know what he doin'
They wanna take it to trial, so he take it to trial
But that little nigga goin' through it 
He was just holdin' it down for his mans 'cause he wasn't the one that was doin' the shootin' 
He didn't cop out to this damn lie, call home and found out his man died
He looked up to the sky like, ""Damn, why?""
'Cause he's locked in the cell and he can't slide
All hell break lose when that man cry, you can see the demon in his damn eyes
That nigga a vampire, hah 
If he want you dead, then it's verified 
And he went back in his cell and he thought to himself like, ""Damn, I feel a lil' stupid""
He got a big gun in the crib but he's stuck in the jam and he can't even use it
He want a re-trial and take back everything that he said 'cause he know he ain't do it
Lil' homie a real nigga, he done made a decision already and he stickin' to it
Uh, yeah, he stickin' to it, uh

Yeah, huh

Although we in love, we are not the same

Georgia Peach on each side like it's ATL, ho 
You lackin' , you trippin', you slackin' 
Impatient-ly waitin' 
Confused, like ""What happened?""
How you get a attitude 'cause I'm gettin' mad?

Ahh, the freeway, picked up traffic
What the fuck is you doin'? We gotta dip-dip-dip-dip-dip

Waitin' for that last minute for your goddamn hair
Now stop playin' games, girl, and bring your ass downstairs

""Hey! How you doin'?"" ""I'm good"" ""I ain't too bad""
""Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha,"" hit her with a few fake laughs

She talkin' my ear off, it's sympathy I lack
I care about one thing: where the fuck you at? 
Anyway, gotta pay a little more
If we late to the jet
Gotta jet 'cause the boat leave at eight
And we got supper on the upper deck and the orchestra

Nigo,Hear Me Clearly by Pusha T & Nigo,"
Hear me clearly, if y'all niggas fear me, just say y'all fear me

These drug dealer Rollies is my TikTok and Triller
Insecure bitches get lip fillers
Covered in white like bridezilla and never been caught
So what's the Shiggy dance for a brick nigga?
Extracurricular, art buyer, 812 'Rari driver
Spent six just to make the roof, Harry Potter
Kilogram Kickstarter, push a brick harder
Left my elbow in the pot, à la Vince Carter
Compared to two martyrs but I'm chasin' moguls
Bosses meet for Hamachi in the back of Nobu
No phones allowed, no phones allowed
Cell towers gon' ping from the nearest cloud
My JanSporters, my transporters and Jan's daughter
Who put up extra bedsheets to block the camcorders?
You place orders, I hedge bets
Promises are when you follow through with your threats, nigga

Hear me clearly, if y'all niggas fear me
Just say y'all fear me, fuck all these fairy tales
Hear me clearly, if y'all niggas fear me
Just say y'all fear me, fuck all these fairy tales

Buy your bitch a Richard Mille, if she like Meeks
Let no nigga claim rich, and let 'em buy you sneaks
Wish upon a star that's beyond yo' reach
Or you can lay with him in misery, and grind yo' teeth
Let a brick-nigga help you find your peace
G-Wagon, your seats, Gs cover your pleats
Ten toes down, Loewe cover the cleats
Dope sell itself, got a trunk full of receipts
Is you looking for me, or are we looking for Meech?
Stand on my standards, expanded with the Ziploc
Even if a nigga number better, never clique hop
Never tell a jeweller what you spent for your wristwatch
And we don't fuck bitches who fuck niggas on TikTok
See the difference 'tween me and them
I move to a different drum like EDM
This coke speaks to my soul like a medium, fucking comedians

Hear me clearly, if y'all niggas fear me
Just say y'all fear me, fuck all these fairy tales
Hear me clearly, if y'all niggas fear me
Just say y'all fear me, fuck all these fairy tales"

Test the boy Le Suess like I came to tune your motor
Motherfuck a mumble rapper, I'd rather be a mogul
Million dollar market deals closin' on my mobile
Keep the grass cut, got a phobia for cobra
You should low-key fuck the world when I'm vulgar
Man, I used to listen to that nigga when I was younger
Found out he's a poser when I got a lil' older
My bitch used to model for the Vogue, but she older
A truce and a foe, sittin' 'round watchin' poker
No buns in the oven, or babies in the stroller
Just guns in the cupboard, and some ladies comin' over
See I'm a pretty boy, manicures with the rollers
And babushkas on the head, like grandmothers and the Roman
Some women throw me bras, some women throw me roses
Might even flash a titty while she on a nigga shoulders
They goin' crazy at my shows, she passed out if I noticed her

Been ill since I was twelve, was Rocky but ended swell

'Cause I spit fire, and shit cold
This shit so mean, nice rocks and I get stones
This shit so clean and bright, bold 
The gold got a grip hold
All these Lucky Charms like a thick bowl
The diamonds all appraised , yeah
Y'all go to Avianne and y'all get a lease in that bitch
My earlobes got them yellow boogers like I sneezed in that bitch 
Your 808s is dry, you need to put some grease in that bitch
And let it sit, nigga, fuck what you heard 
And fuck rap, I make a living off that four-letter word 
One-stop shop, nigga, just to sell them shoes
The profit margins lookin' higher than them airplane views
Y'all getting fucked in your deals, and they share that lube
I push the cum-colored Beamer and the inside blue 
I push an Elon too, and the 675
The Longtail like the mane that's on A$AP Lou
Whips, whips, whips, whips, Kunta started a fight
The 720 ordered and I still go ride me a bike
But don't follow in yours , Vill behind me in sight 
My niggas strictly like 9s, like young Mike and his type 
Rip, you better zip that lip and zip up quick
And shit, he'd probably suck my dick then kiss his bitch 
It's two sides to each coin, I call heads 
Been countin' so much goddamn coin, my palm red 
I spend it on some books and some diamonds that shed light

Drugs got me sweatin', but the room gettin' colder
Lookin' at the devil and the angel on my shoulder
Will I die tonight? I don't know, is it over?
Lookin' for my next high, I'm lookin' for closure

Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

Told her if I die, I'ma die young
Every day I've been gettin' fucked up
Finally know the difference between love and drugs
Shawty tell me I should really sober up
This shit ain't fiction, it's too real, too real
Fuck one dose, I need two pills, two pills
I'm lookin' for trouble so I know I'm gonna find it
Ring, ring, plug hit my phone, perfect timin'

But I'm not wrong, no, I'm not wrong
Girl, you hate it when I'm too high
But that's where I belong, where I belong

If I overdose, bae, are you gon' drop with me?

Jim Jones,We Fly High by Jim Jones,"
I wear a mean dark pair of shades
And you can't see my eyes
Unless my head is bent, you dig?


We fly high, no lie , you know this 
Foreign rides outside , it's like showbiz

We stay fly , no lie, and you know this

Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

Ya boy gettin' paper , I buy big cars 
Eight fly rides just to drive in my garage

Stay sky high , fly with the stars 
G4 Flights
, 80 grand large 
So we lean with it, pop with it 
'Vertible Jones, mean with the top missin'

I'm sittin' clean with the bottom kitted 
I hopped out, saggy jeans and my rock glistened 
But I spent about 8 grand
Mami on stage doin' the rain dance

She let it hit the floor, made it pop 
Got my pedal to the floor screamin', ""Fuck the cops!"" 

We fly high, no lie, you know this 
Foreign rides outside, it's like showbiz
We stay fly, no lie, and you know this

Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

Slow down, here tonight, could be gone tomorrow 
So I speed through life like there's no tomorrow 
Hundred G's worth of ice on the Audemars 
And we in the street life 'til they call the law 
I made the whip get naked 
While I switch gears, bitch lookin' at the bracelet

Step out, show me what you all about
Flashbacks to last night of me ballin' out

1 AM, we was at the club 
2 AM, ten bottles of bub

And by 3-somethin' I was thinkin' 'bout grub
So I stumbled to the car due to drinks and the drugs 

We fly high, no lie, you know this 
Foreign rides outside, it's like showbiz
We stay fly, no lie, and you know this

Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused
 I keep 20 in the pocket 
You talkin’ buck 80 if the Bentley is the topic 
But of course gotta fly the Spur 
To the hood and roll dice on side the curb 
But I know a G a bet may sound absurd 
Drive 80 up Lenox 'cause I got a urge 
The rap game like the crack game
Lifestyle rich, famous
, livin' in the fast lane 
So when I bleep, shorty bleep back
Lou' Vuitton belt where I'm keepin’ all the heat strapped 
I beat the trial over Rucker 
All guns loaded and I'm back, motherfucker 

We fly high, no lie, you know this 
Foreign rides outside, it's like showbiz
We fly high, no lie, you know this 
Foreign rides outside, it's like showbiz 
We stay fly , no lie , and you know this

Hips and thighs , oh my , stay focused

Chea, you niggas need to stay focused when you dealin' with a motherfuckin' G
You know my name, Jones,
One Eye
,
Capo Status
, all the above, motherfucka
This Dipset, ByrdGang, we born to fly, y'all know the rules: fall back or fall back
Someone tell my bitch Summer I'm lookin' for her, ya dig? Another day another dollar, fast life fucka

He/She, blowticious

Lamborghini, is audicious 
From Harlem to Hollywood, I'm still hood 
500 horses stuffed in my Ferrari hood 
Fuck-niggas talk about MC's on da hills
Hip-Hop is dead, so Killa gave me the wheel 
Black cards fever get these niggas feelin' ill 
It's hot fo' now, niggas givin' out deals 

I'm flyin' up Lenox in the Bentley, all crazy 
The roof topless, I'm showin' my ass 
I brought New York back, you niggas ain't got a chance 


I ain't gon' lie, I'm fucked up, Phil died and we all sad
Only thing get us by now, and that's to ball, dad
5 mil on the crib, 50 on the dogtag
Cracks in the deal, that's 20 mil, I done gone mad
Naw I had to gon' grab the Spyda at the red light
Blue fluorescent headlight, ya betta get ya bread right
You ain't a balla, you chase checks, I check right
Even when it's dark outside, I bet my neck bright

Ayo hold up, pick a restaurant,
Chows or Chin Chin
Now pick a car, which one I ain't been in?
Pick a watch, as long as the hand spinnin'
Pick a actress, which one I ain't swim in
 The yacht's still on deck
Retirement plan, I dropped it on her neck
I'm still spendin' ol' money
Benjamin's Remix, 10 year ago money muthafuckas


Now girl I don't mean to be an agitator
But when I get movin' I'm a smooth operator
Ay, money ain't a thing, that's why I spend it
Ya cars like ya home, everthing rented
I'll buy your building, you'll be my tenant
My money comes fast just like a leopard
I'm about my green, no it ain't tennis
Play wit' my green, I'll become ya dentist
I'll swing that tool around
Then begin the root canal, Blaow
 Boy you don't wanna start it here
Only time y'all dudes ball is in a barber's chair
Baldheads, I'm taking rock and roll to another level
Iced-out skull heads
500 on the Bentley, 50 G's on the caddy
100 G's on my ho, cuz we both livin' lavished
Doin' my thang with this uptown swang
Niggas get it how we live like money ain't a thang 
Stuntin' on dem thangs, every time you see my swagger
Every time you see me hang, best believe I got that thang
Pop up at da club, niggas show them hoes love
Cuz they know we make it rain, so they show a gangsta love

Look like I'm skatin' on ice like Kristi Yamaguchi
Sittin' up in the Chevy
eatin' BlowFish Sushi
550 mint-colored Benz
,
me and Jim
Wit' the Band Camp Twins and they blowin' our fluties
Hell Rell block, so you know we gettin' kufis
Iceberg drop nigga now I'm ridin' goofy
28 inches in the air, know I'm ballin'
Cuz my whole wrist pink and my neck kinda bluey, Dro


You've just been included in the Ballaz Extravaganza
You are now a Ballaholic, just like my team

Tight grip on the Escalade pole

Red bandana wrapped around the chrome .44
Gun smokin' like Suge cigar
Show me how you stunt you thrown outta movin' car
If that thing come out, its murder she wrote
If Doc come out, its 30 Impalas on the boat
Nigga, we do this everyday
Llamas under the thermal, waitin' by ya stairs like Mary J
Beat niggas ride dirty like Jazze Pha, Cassius Clay
Knock a nigga out on the ave today
Bring the mack ya way me and Santana
Blowin' in the crowd like Donnie Hathaway
Westside blood-gang, niggas know what I'm about
And they know I'm ruff ridin' so they knockself out

Now I ride with my vest, .45 and my tech
Big 4 in the '64, like I'm in the West
Not petrified to put 5 in ya chest

Razor or ox 
As I lay in the drop

Move the H on our block, in front of H&R block
See the face on our watch, put ya face on our cock 
I keep the Luger hugged
Show you how to use a snub
Whoopty-whoo, fuck around be you I plug

Ay killa you know the rules dip set for life

I'm all about that motherfucking paper ho
This song goes out to all my money making hoes
60 rackz in my pocket, 60 rackz in my jeans
60 rackz in my pocket, top back when I lean
I pull up in that motherfucking Phantom Ghost
This song goes out to all my niggas getting dough
60 rackz in my pocket, 60 rackz in my jeans
60 rackz in my pocket top back when I lean

60 racks thats no dough, mattes fact thats ho dough
I made that when I transported, back and forth taking Nodoze
Rolex rose gold,
my neck so cold
She seen't that quarter chill, V in black, quarter mill
We don't shop at saveraux, 60 thou for the roll
Drop top foreign flow, this is not affordable
Wrist cold, caught the flu, Cartier said quarter to
She sucked my dick, swallowed it, my watch still said quarter to
Dipset, Young Money, niggas know that that money grown
Wanna talk to me, you better talk to me, from that pool deck of my summer home 
My summer home, pool deck with like a hundred on
Who's a threat? Got a pool net, and my jewels wet like a thunderstorm


Swear to God I go so hard, they call me Tunechi fuck 'em all
Can't pack no gun, so I keep a knife like that fuckin' Chucky doll
I'm at your neck like a shawl, on your ass like some drawers
I got 3 hoes with me, fuck, I look like Santa Claus
And I got bad bitches all over me, real niggas that roll with me
And we get off weight like that one bitch from Floetry
Got a pair of pants with 4 pockets, 15K in each of 'em
Do the math you mo'fucka,

Skating with my homeboys, talking shit smoking weed
I oversee everything, niggas call me overseas
Young mulah mothafucka, click clack boo ya, mothafucka
60 rackz in my pocket, try to jack and get bodied
Young Tunechi

I got an ill gift, I'm real swift, they be like, ""Damn, he still rich""
When I send my men in black listen none of them niggas is will smith
I sell coke, I deal piff, when I ride by in that black on black
Ménage à trois with two double D's, come to see that's racks on racks
They ship it in, I give it to ya on the ground or in the air
They drop it off, they're like LeBron in the 4th quarter, I give it there
I be me, you be you, apologies to Groovie Lou
Sorry, brah, I ain't fuckin' with mase, yea yea tell 'em you be cool
Me I rep that Hud 6,

House money on the necklace the pigs want him arrested
Cause I'm obsessed with the guns and the vest's
Cause when you get some cake, the candles come with a death wish!
The rock star living , the hot cars and women 
...the God forgive him, hope the cop cars don't get 'em 
This for them niggas that...at the club, throwing stacks 
At Star Wars, they threw two I threw four back!
And I'm back, it's Mr. New York City
My hat to the back, I stay flyer than a Frisbee

Tell 'em Ron Browz here hottest in America
Gimme sixteen bars and you know I tear it up
Know it's me when you see this fur in your area
And she call me all night cause you can get it up
On my neck on my wrist everything is litted up
Drinkin bottles of that Clicquot 'till I spit it up
Only get one life so you gotta live it up
 If you in the things I'm in
Shorty we can be friends, shorty we can be friends
Right now, I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance
 
When I go to the dealer you know I cop that 
Brand new 'rarri and the roof drop back 
Came through Harlem like the Rooftop back 
Money in the bank man you know don't stop that 
 Now we tryin to get up in the club
 Try to tell me no cause I'm rollin with the thugs
 Until I flash a couple of dollars 
Tell 'em we only want tables and we buyin out the bottles
 Y'all know the order
Tell 'em ten Rose's and a few cold waters 
Only Petron and a couple of lemons 
Ten thousand dollars stuffed up in the denims 
We standin on couches, a couple of women 
We was ballin hard it was just the ninth inning 
He told shorty we could be friends 
And your friends could meet my friends 
And we could do this on the weekend or on the weekday
We could do this on the freeway and get it in the freak way
SHIT! We could get in on three way 
Blackberry two way, souped up cars on the thruway 
We superstars no Lupe
, we could do this like a duet
But y'all be the singers on the mic, wait let me dim the lights
This was in the car while I was stoppin at the light

How we ball in the club I know you hate it
Mommy dancin on the floor all like she naked
When she lay down with you I know she fake it
All the girls give it to me I ain't gotta take it
OHHHH! Pop champagne!
OHHHH! Pop champagne!
OHHHH! We pop champagne!
OHHHH! We pop champagne!
Baby I wanna see you work  See you dance 
Without no shirt, without those pants
Pop champagne ain't a damn thing change
Spray it in the air make it champagne rain
Buckets of ice keep the champagne cool
Mommy got a body see that damn thing move
It's no sex in the champagne room
Says who? Baby I'll break all rules
Bring it here and I'll break off you
She see me in V.I.P. and wanna break on through
When she with you, she lyin, but she fake it
When she with me, she like it, she never fake it

I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance

How we ball in the club I know you hate it
Mommy dancin on the floor all like she naked
When she lay down with you I know she fake it
All the girls give it to me I ain't gotta take it
OHHHH! Pop champagne!
OHHHH! Pop champagne!
OHHHH! We pop champagne!

You see rap music is subliminal
But the music for us is like our own diary
Something like a confession
They tell me life is a bitch 
She somethin' like the seasons just like mother nature
She comes and go as she please
Thats why they get their period once a month 
I say that to say this if you think that bitch
The summer is yours 
She could be cheating on you
Ya heard

It's got me feelin' like opium
I'm tryna dance with the loaded M
Open a bottle and it goes around
I'm leavin' drunk 'bout 4 A.M
And watch me jump up in a Dolce Benz
Top down with the pokey rims
And now I'm swervin' so you know I'm bent
I lost count, who knows what I spent
I recall nine Cliques
Bitches steppin' on my Nike sneakers
With one hand in the sky and the other hand was on her thigh
I was grindin' to the beat with my hammer on my side
Now the G's only as we speed to the Rolex
And three or four G's is what we sneeze at the Rolex
Playing some, glance at my Chopard, it's 'bout 6 A.M
You think the night is over but it just begin
They say Club Space like Bad Boys 2
You can see the snow bunnies doin' what bad girls do
Thats ecstasy weed that had girl to
Scoop the bitch that had keys that sellin' fast off blue
Now I'm speedin' to the telly got the Porsche behind
Tryna get in her belly the only thought on my mind
Like damn, not tryna be pushy or nothing
But since the strip joint girl, I should have been fucking

Spendin' my summers with the drop top low
Throwin' my 100s at the top notch hoes
And we smokin' on the top notch dro
That's a summer with Miami
Bottle in the air, livin' without a care
Shawty beside me, blowin' through her hair
Hold on, no
That's a summer with Miami

I can't keep it long anymore
I be with my girl when it starts to snow, I get bored
And when you love three women, it's hard to keepin' up with the lies
You see spring's my first love, I started creepin' with July
Used to say I had some shows, catch a plane to M-I
Then I started trickin' dough and bought a Range for July
Mama said I'm love sick over this hot ass hoochie
And I first seen her when I told Nas I'd slap off his kufi
We don't play disrespect but that was the day that me met
Summer jam '02, I hit the stage with my set
But her man, he was from Brooklyn she still slipped me the number
She said he's on vacation, so get with me this summer
Then I been flirtin' with her over the past two years
Now she hates seein' me in the winter, ain't gon' last through the year
So now I'm lookin' at winter like life's an adventure
And then when June comes, I'll be gone 'til September
Now would you hate me for that?
I know your heart's cold could you wait 'til I'm back
I'm just a sucker for love
But a nigga hold you down if you wanna fuck with a thug
Spendin' my summers with the drop top low
Throwin' my 100s at the top notch hoes
And we smokin' on the top notch dro
That's a summer with Miami
Bottle in the air, livin' without a care
Shawty beside me, blowin' through her hair
Hold on, no
That's a summer with Miami"

I been tryna get the money, I been tryna feed my fam

I was thinkin' 'bout the Rollie, but I went and got the Richie
Then I went and put my momma in the Benz 
I get it in , in the pent' suite fuckin' two twins
I thought about the Glock, but I went F&N 
And a nigga spin this shit without a pen 
I call Jimmy, kick it with the billies 
We already ran up a milli' 
So that shit ain't really interestin' 
He outta line, he get a penalty 
Said he start it, then I'ma finish him 
Stomp a nigga, fed up, in my Timberlands 
Hangin' with the vampires and gremlins 
Got them hoes lined up, assembly 
Not your average nigga in the industry

We set the trends

First nigga come through in True Religion 
Cut my money back up, put a kilo on my neck
Man this shit is worth like two bitches 
Come through drippin' 
First nigga move, I'm hit 'em 
The next nigga move, you go wit' 'em
But I ain't here to talk no middleman shit
You got a boss? Then you should go get 'em
Where he at? We set the trends
Big F&N when I step out the Benz 
My lil' bousin' did it, man
He just been trapped in six
Now he fresh out the pen 
You know what's up, we goin' up
We are not comin' down 
This bitch don't trip, better watch for the crown
All these rocks in my watch with the crown
Now it's chop a nigga down 

Chop a nigga down, choppa gang 
The thirty holdin' up the wallet chain 
Movin' like the fuckin' president 
Ten cars hoggin' up the lane 
Trappin' at the house before the fame 
Diamonds do the flash, like I'm walkin', take a picture 
He'll do it for the cheap when you send him on a mission 
Quickest wipe down, wipe his name off the list 
Flip the switch on it , then the sticks started glistenin' 
If I'm gon' smoke it then we raise a tissue 
My pinky one-forty and my watch is three-fifty
My bitch like to scissor, she came with three bitches 
We don't fuck with snitchin', we protect the business 
We straight out the trenches, the mud was sticky 
It too many real niggas, we don't fake kick it 
We set the trend in the cities 
We came to fuck up the city, just Migos and Jimmy 
Uh, we set the trends 
Bringin' in ends 
I'ma have to call my accountant to make sure this shit came in 

Hundred-fifty on the Panamera

Put a Richard on my wrist, it be retarded like Little Daryl
Niggas want the smoke, I tell 'em try me, nigga, dare 'em 
White Lamborghini, yeah I call that bitch a Karen 
When I hit the Draco that bitch soundin' like a snare 
The way the diamonds hittin' off the Patek, it ain't fair 
I'ma hit your bitch and give her back, I like to share 'em 
Fuckin' with Diego, man, Diego serve  
Automatic when I get to spinnin' on the block 
Bought a Glock, 'cause then I bought a switch, call it mop 
I don't know the time but it's three hunnid for this watch 
I'ma put a thot up on the opp and get the drop 
Niggas try to plot then we gon' hit him like the WAP 
I'm thinkin' like I'm Roddy Ricch, the stick up in the box 
I told that bitch no feelings, I just really want the top 
If you ain't talkin' millions, ain't no business, ain't no talk
Twenty-five racks, you can buy some white chalk 
Ferrari lookin' like a caterpillar when it walk 
Swimmin' with piranhas, we was swimmin' with the sharks 
I can see the flash when the choppas start to spark 
Two hundred the dash on the coupe I just bought 
Two milli' in cash, I just saved up in the vault 
Started in the bando, now we trappin' out a loft 
The first three letters of my name, he got off'd

Half of milli all in the bag, if this was Philly they would say I'm in my bag 
Quarter milli with the paper tag
And I keep the nine milli playing laser tag
Condo in Miami that's my favorite pad
Watching Rondo vs Miami he just made a pass
Gotta coupe it when we racing past
Body stupid with a crazy ass 
High heels, red bottoms
And I miss my nigga Zoe for real cause the feds gottem
You doing 30 pray for 65 percent
In a car dirty, bitch you know im riding bent

Kingpin, 848
,
lights camera action, first 48
Fly bitches, meet me at the bar
And when they catch us we gonna get the biggest charge
Kingpin 848, sex money murder, first 48
Live niggas buy the biggest cars
And when they catch us we gonna get the biggest charge

Still slanging cocaine boy, still gang bangin' with my gang boys
Swagged up, still rocking big chains boy
Who wanna hear that chopper make noise?
I'm smoking dope, straight out the gas mask
It's big b's nine tray billy bad ass
I'm selling coke whats the quote, I match that
Matter fact, I got them for half that
How many mug shots they gonna taking me
Before they understand they ain't gonna pin a case on me
Kush stay rolled up, pocket full of fast money shirt say slowbucks


I pulled up, hopped out, through the deuces
Love that smell and that these haters blowing kush
I got muscle with my hood call me flocka bush
Get your head knocked off for a couple bands
And hear the ... my youngest, let them ... around
Told them keep shooting no stopping unless you're gun jam
We got automatic big guns like call of duty
Keep it ... that's my call of duty
Fly young niggas rob you in some louie
When upon my bus got burned now he trying to sue me
Free my brother gucci, and my nigga boosie
I swear to god my life is like a fucking movie"

I think my critics need to hear this
Or anyone who doubts my political awareness
I'm what you call a democratic with an automatic
A rebel and a bezel when I just ordered the Patek
You could build a wall as tall as the sky 
We all know the coke still go far from the sky
Papi had a room with a wall full of pies
This is America, baby, where we fall for the lies 
We never had much, but we had us 
And even when the bills didn’t add up
We cooked up coke and it was crills that we bagged up
We sold in broad day and police still didn't bag us
I be ready to kill one of you MAGA's 
Shit, I’m throwin' shots, man, you still throwin' daggers
And my thoughts on the legalization
And they tryna turn weed into a legal libation
Why won't they legalize Haitians? 
And throw on the Cubans too
I told my jeweler he could throw on a Cuban too
Or bust down a Rollie, it's frozen at two to two 
I took a private jet and you know where I flew the crew 
Them coconut drinks that come with umbrellas in 'em
In the rain, we buy Rolls's that come with umbrellas in 'em 
The transition, baby, that was the hardest part
Police pulled me over and they still ripped my car apart 
So, I ain’t got to kneel just to stand with you 
I was really in the field with them hand pistols 
I was really throwin' bullets like the Cap, huh, Cap, huh

I mean, uh

Shine a light on my feet, Lord, watch my steps
This ghost in my head, ghost in my head
Got the world after me but I can’t look back
This ghost in my head, ghost in my head

Life's so short but the money's so long
Drop-tops in the summertime, mink coats when it's cold
But I’m cold every night 
Please Lord, hold me, hold me close 

Pushin' Phantoms, so they feel I'm preachin' propaganda
Say a prayer for my niggas or we light a candle
All the squares in your circle, time to change the channel
Or unplug the television 'cause this shit is mental 
My sneakers Chanel, Grim Reaper for real
I get beats from Pharrell, you should see how I live
Kids in Montessori school, logos in the pool
I done put in all my work, no longer holding tools
Look into my eyes, you can see the murders
Smell the kilos on me, now we flippin' burgers
Ride through the ghetto, look for shit to purchase
Do it for the fam, don't forget your purpose
When you sellin' grams, then you just a merchant, nigga
When you sellin' grams, then you just a merchant
Eyes open wide, slither with a serpent 
Closed casket meaning God, close the curtains 
Meaning God, close the curtains 
Meaning God, close the curtains 
God, close the curtains 
Oh Lord
Shine a light on my feet, Lord, watch my steps
This ghost in my head, ghost in my head
Got the world after me but I can't look back
This ghost in my head, ghost in my head

Shine a light on my feet, Lord, watch my steps
Ghost in my head, ghost in my head
Got the world after me but I can't look back

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or better known as ADHD, is a mental disorder that affects an individual's ability to focus
Causing them to move around more frequently
They may also have trouble controlling their impulsive behaviors

One time for them prayin' on my downfall 
Two times for the homies in the chow hall 
Three times for them hoes on the internet
Shittin' on niggas when they really should get out more
Four times for the days that were all bad 
Five times for the bitches who ain't called back 
Six times for the kids like me who got ADHD just to— 

Kidnap a nigga like ISIS 
Turn a whole world to a crisis 
Walk around the city with a ice pick
I been paranoid, usually, I ain't like this 
Ain't no tellin' how crazy I might get, uh 
Beat the police with a nightstick 
In my whole life, I been lifeless
Now I'm so fly, I'm a muhfuckin' flight risk 
Fuck a couple hoes 'til I pass out 
Niggas throwin' stones at my glass house 
I remember sleepin' on my dad's couch 
Now I got the Bentley, and it's blacked out 
Family lookin' at me like a cash cow 
Errybody dissin' just to have clout 
Thought you had a chance, now you assed out
Nigga, I'm the muhfuckin' man, where you at now? 
Fuck it, I'ma hit 'em 'til they jumpin'
I ain't trippin', this is nothin' 
I been livin' in the dungeon
I done held a couple grudges
Went to hell and got abducted
Meet the devil, I'm his cousin
I ain't settlin' for nothin' 
Got a metal in the truck, I keep a semi when I'm bussin'
Niggas duckin' 
Even Stevie Wonder could've see it comin' 
I ain't judgin', I just want the money, I don't need a budget
I been hungry, I ain't got no oven 
But I got the munchies, nigga
How you gon' move on the front line? 
If I don't fuck with you, I just cut ties 
My high school teacher said I'd never be shit
Tell that bitch that I turned out just fine 
And no, I don't know you for the twelfth time 
We do not share the same bloodline 
You love to run your mouth like a tough guy
Hope you keep the same energy when it's crunch time 

According to the American Psychiatric Association
It affects roughly eight percent of children
And two percent of adults
Commonly believed to only affect boys
Because they are perceived as rowdy and rambunctious

One time for them prayin' on my downfall 
Two times for them bitches in the South Shore 
Three times for them days on the block
Gettin' chased by the cops like a motherfuckin' outlaw
Four times for them days that were all bad

Six times for the kids like me who got ADHD just to— 

Me and Joyner need a couple hearses 
Double homicide, kill the beat and the verses

What's beef?
Beef is when you murder motherfuckers on a beat
Kill 'em all, kill 'em all
Nah, nah, what's beef?
Beef is brothers dyin' over shit
That never mattered in the first place, lyin' in the street
What's peace?
Peace is when you leave it in the past, let it heal like a cast
When enough time pass, then you blast
Kinda like John Wick, bars like a convict
Fuck around and you don't wanna start shit, woo!
Comin' with the hot shit, all they do is talk shit
You could never top it, boy, just stop, stop it
High and drunk, call that HD vision
All these other motherfuckers full of indecision
And I murder with precision all over your television
I'm numero uno, number one and you is just a subdivision
Never listen, we gon' leave them missin'
That's the mission like ISIS 
Ain't no time to bicker over who the nicest
It's Logic, it's obvious, just ask the audience
I've come to body this shit 
Yes, it's egregious, I'm Regis
You Kelly, you pussy,
you pussy
Don't push me, I'm Louis Vuitton

Double homicide, kill the beat and the verses
Everybody livin' on the surface
But we came from the underground, yeah, we deserve it
Yeah, uh, far from the minimum, killin' 'em with no Ritalin
And 5'9"" was the middleman to get 'em in the same room
Now we on the same tune, and we sealed the game's doom
The illest of lyricists on the same shit
RattPack, clap back on the gang shit
Do it for the love of rap, not for the fame shit, woo!
One time for the Grammy that I never got
Two times for the Garden that I sold out
Three times for the street crimes that I committed
Yeah, I did it, but thank God that I made it out
Four times 'cause I'm a fuckin' bastard
Five times Platinum with my last shit
Six times for the beats and the rhymes
Fuck the heat and the crime
Keep the peace like a waistline, woo!

Joyner Lucas,I'm Sorry by Joyner Lucas,"
Go ahead and call me a coward
Say that I'm not strong because I'm not like you
Go ahead and call me crazy
'Cause I live in a maze, tell me how about you?
I think I live in my head
Sometimes I think that I'm dead, I hide behind my youth
Know I been losing my mind
And I'm a little behind, step inside my shoes
'Cause I've never been happy with myself
And I don't need no one feeling bad for me
Tryna to offer me pity and throw jabs at me
Wanna give me advice and then laugh at me
Behind closed doors, just close the door
Let me be by myself—just me and myself
I'm tired of living, I cry
I hear it's easy to die, I wanna see for myself
And I know that sounds crazy to everyone else
But I'm depressed as fuck, stressed as fuck
Ain't no medicine that could cure what's the test as drugs
I mean, I need extra love
And that ain't even enough, said that ain't even enough
And where the fuck is God? 
Damn, maybe I ain't believing enough
But today, we gonna see if he's real
And if He is, then I guess I'm prolly going to hell
Look, I ain't wanna die like this
I ain't picture my life like this
They don't know what it's like like this
Pretending I'm happy so I can smile like this, and laugh like you
Sometimes I wonder if I ever act like you
Could I finally fit in and maybe relax like, ""Woo!""
Or would you feel lost without me?
'Cause honestly, I think the world is better off without me
And my mind's spinning, this is the line finish
Truth is I don't care how they feel about my feelings
I made up my mind, I'm going out like Robin Williams
I guess I'm not the Ordinary People of John Legend
And I've been suicidal since the day I was nine, shit
Okay, the day I was nine
I've been tired of being bullied, couldn't stay out the fire
Grandma told me I should take it one day at a time
And dammit, look at me now, fuck
Fuck, pen runnin' out, shit, fu—, ugh
Look, just know it's a new day
But if you reading this, then it's prolly too late, blaow!

Just make sure you tell my family it's okay,
I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
Just make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me

I hope you got what you wanted
I hope you finally happy, it's too late for you
Been going out of my mind
You don't know how many times that I done prayed for you
I hope you hear me, goddammit
'Cause I got so much shit that I wanna say to you
I used to shine, now I'm all in the dark
I remember I used to tell you to follow your heart
But goddammit, look at you now, it's all of your fault
How could you? Maybe it's my fault
I shoulda paid more attention to what you been doin'
Maybe I should have been more of an influence
I can't believe that you're dead, I fu–
I read your letter and all I could do is have mixed feelings about it
But I'll forever be attached to you 
Part of me feels bad for you
A part of me feels like you weak and I'm mad at you
And I don't mean to be insensitive
But I don't understand how we couldn't prevent this shit
You took the easy way out, goddammit, you did
I mean, look what you did, I'm so fucking upset
How could you be so selfish?
Nigga, how could you be so selfish?
Now you're gone, you done left me so helpless
I wonder what God thinks, I hope you in God's place behaving yourself
Yo, what the fuck you gotta say for yourself? 
Look, I really feel lost without you
I hate the fact you think the world is better off without you
And my mind's spinning, this is the line finish
Truth is: I don't care how you feel about my feelings
And I'd be lying to you if I told you I'm fine, listen
I know that you can hear me, all I need is like five minutes
I just wanna reach inside the casket and pull you out
I'm sorry this is something that we both couldn't figure out
I wish I could hear you now, is your soul missing?
I wonder if you could do it again, would you do it different?
Tell me what death is like
Was it meant for you, brodie?
Did the heaven support it?
Are you fucking happy now? Did you get what you wanted?
Isn't this what you wanted? I feel the temperature falling
And you've been suicidal back then you were nine?
Yeah, even back then, you was nine
We was living on the edge, couldn't stay out the fire
Grandma told us we should take it one day at a time
And damn it, look at you now, shit
But it's a new day
And if you can't hear me, it's probably too late, fuck!
Just make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry,
so much weighing on me
Just make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
Just make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
Just make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry

You motherfuckers need to get your damn priorities straight, wait
It's like you're proud to be fake
But you lazy as fuck
And you'd rather sell drugs than get a job and be straight
And then you turn around and complain about the poverty rate? Fuck outta my face
You can't escape problems
You can pray for some change, but can't break a dollar
Got nobody else to blame, so you blame Donald
""They fuck the world with a Make America Great condom""
My voice been back
I'm not racist, my sister's boyfriend's black
I'm not racist, my sister-in-law's baby cousin Tracy got a brother and his girlfriend's black
My head's in the cloud
Heard there's not enough jobs for all the men in your house
Maybe we should build a wall to keep the Mexicans out
Or maybe we should send 'em all to the ghetto for now
I'm not racist, and I never lie
But I think there's a disconnect between your culture and mine
I worship the Einsteins, study the Steve Jobs
But you ride 2Pac's dick like he was a fuckin' god, oh my God
And all you care about is rappin' and stuntin' and bein ratchet, and that's the nigga within you
Music rottin' your brain and slowly start to convince you
Then you let your kids listen and then the cycle continues
Blame it all on the menu, blame it on those drinks
Blame it on everybody except for your own race
Blame it on white privileges, blame it on white kids
And just blame it on white citizens, aim at the vice president
Bunch of class clowns
Niggas kneelin' on the field, that's a flag down
How dare you try to make demands for this money?
You gon' show us some respect, you gon' stand for this country,
nigger
I'm not racist, I'm just prepared for this type of war
I heard Eminem's rap at the awards, who's he fightin' for?
Y'all can take that motherfucker too, he ain't white no more
It's like you wanna be so famous
You'll do anything for attention and a little payment
I can't take you nowhere without people pointin' fingers
Pants hangin' off your ass, you ain't got no home trainin'?
Pull your fuckin' pants up, nigga
Put that suit back on, take that durag off
Take that gold out your mouth, quit the pitiful stuff
And then maybe police'd stop killin' you fucks, yo, what the fuck?
I'm not racist
It's like we're livin' in the same building, but split into two floors
I'm not racist
But there's two sides to every story, I wish that I knew yours
I wish that I knew yours
I'm not racist, I swear

With all disrespect
I don't really like you white motherfuckers, that's just where I'm at
Screaming, ""All Lives Matter,"" is a protest to my protest, what kind of shit is that?
And that's one war you'll never win
The power in the word, ""Nigga,"" is a different sin
We shouldn't say it, but we do, and that's just what it is
But that don't mean that you can say it just 'cause you got nigga friends
Nigga
That word was originated for you to keep us under
And when we use it, we know that's just how we greet each other
And when you use it, we know there's a double meaning under
And even if I wasn't picking cotton physically
That don't mean I'm not affected by the history
My grandmama was a slave, that shit gets to me
And you ain't got no motherfuckin' sympathy, you pussy nigga
I'm sorry, you can never feel my life
Tryna have faith, but I never felt alright
It's hard to elevate when this country's ran by whites
Judging me by my skin color and my blackness
Tryna find a job but ain't nobody call me back yet
Now I gotta sell drugs to put food in my cabinet
You crackers ain't slick, this is all a part of your tactics
Don't talk about no motherfuckin' taxes
When I ain't making no dough
You think you know everything, but you don't
You wanna copy our slang and everything that we know
Try to steal black culture and then make it your own, woah
Fuck, I'm exhausted
I can't even drive without the cops tryna start shit
I'm tired of the systematic racism bullshit
All you do is false shit, this the shit that I'm forced with
And you don't know shit about my people, that's what bothers you
You don't know about no fried chicken or no barbecue
You don't know about the two-step or no loose change
You don't know about no 2 Chainz or no Kool-Aid, you don't know
And even though Barack was half as black
You hated President Obama, I know that's a fact
You couldn't wait to get him out and put a cracker back
And then you gave us Donald Trump and now it's payback for that
I'm not racist, I never lied
But I know there's a disconnect between your culture and mines
Yeah, I praise 2Pac like he was a fuckin' god
He was fighting for his life way before he fuckin' died, nigga, die, nigga
And all you care about is money and power and being ugly and that's the cracker within you
Hatred all in your brain, it slowly start to convince you
And then you teach it to your children until the cycle continue
Blame it on Puerto Rico, blame it on OJ
Blame it on everybody except for your own race
Blame it on black niggas and blame it on black citizens
Aim at the black businesses, I ain't saying I'm innocent, but
I might be any day now
Treatin' everybody how you want and any way how
I swear North Korea 'bout to bomb us any day now
And now I'm duckin' every time I hear a fuckin' plane now, shit
You know I make a lot of sense, but you just can't admit it
When Eminem went against Trump, that was the illest
'Cause even though he's white, he let us know he standin' with us
I'm not racist, but I cry a lot
You don't know what it's like to be in a frying pot
You don't know what it's like to mind your business
And get stopped by the cops and not know if you 'bout to die or not
You worry 'bout your life, so you take mine
I love you, but I fuckin' hate you at the same time
I wish we could trade shoes or we could change lives
So we could understand each other more, but that'd take time
I'm not racist
It's like we livin' in the same building, but split into both sides
I'm not racist
But there's two sides to every story and now you know mine
Can't erase the scars with a bandage
I'm hopin' maybe we can come to an understandin'
Agree to disagree, we could have an understandin'
I'm not racist"

The man on the horse, all I had was Ralph Lauren
Then I went and signed a deal and bought a pony 
Yeah I'm taking it back and then I'm smacking you bitches and laughing
And I'm killing them, hacking them, and sending your body right back to them
You wonder what's happening

You ain't gonna be happy when I'm on top and I'm gonna be popping
All of you gonna be dropping like birds dropping all on your conscious
All you niggas are watchin I'm spittin', slap all on your coffin, R.I.P
You lost and you fuckas sleepin' you're pillow talkin' 
And you dream all day, that's per year 
All you ho niggas leave your purse here 
I am your favorite rapper's worst fear 
Raised in the mud crying, dirt tears 
Just a bunch of kids in the high chair
Couldn't get a buzz even if you had lightyear
Wouldn't get no love even if your heart's right here
Niggas got guns so nobody want to fight fair, no
Hit 'em with the Ric Flair and the suplex
I ain't never been scared, bitch, I'm ruthless 
Raised by the ghetto
Know some gangs that'll get 'em
Split 'em right down the middle like a fuckin' duplex
Break a nigga toes, make 'em do the two-step
Crib full of hoes, now I feel like Hugh Hef
Got a bad stripper bitch, all we do is have sex
And she love suckin' dick so I call her loose neck 
Makin' a panic with my shit and I'm flippin' up banisters
I'm ready to handle and dismantle and crush and vanish
I hit 'em and send 'em into walls, then I got 'em enchanted
Then my fuckin hands that holdin the hammer bangin' and slammin'
Killin' 'em in the ambulance, they dyin', they bleedin', they tremblin'
I'm really sick and I got a stiff as a fuckin' mannequin
I paint a picture a Picasso vision, all on my cellophane
I got 'em swingin' they on my dick and grabbin my pants again
Now, uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco 
I ain't Spanish but I know the lingo 
Atlantic told me that my flow a hundred
But my album ain't come unless I got a fuckin' single

Bottles in a bucket full of ice 
Better make room, vroom, hear the Lambo 
Bitch, better believe that I'ma sniper 
You know I'm 'bout to take you from your man though 
Pop up with the chopper at artificial niggas actin' like bitches
And it started up a epidemic
It don't make a difference, nigga, we winnin', I'm plenty grinnin'
Hunnid million platinum, fuck it, you ain't gotta listen 
You better step down to me
Feel the dick, bitch, open up your mouth to me
Now choke, talk to the dick, honestly
I'm dope, bitch, comin' like Eenie Meenie Miney Mo 
I don't like when I lose 
If I don't buy her them shoes, I don't like those 
Do anything that I want to
Think I'm gon' dance on the moon like Michael 

While I'm drivin', I'm moonwalkin' in the sky with some shooters
We jump inside of the Buick, you duck and hide from the Rugers

A couple choppers, acoustic in the guitar with no music
Guess I'm alive and I use it, get stuck inside of the cubics

I never lie, but the truth is I'm fuckin' tired of these losers
And all my life want the food when it's supper time and the juice 
But I'd rather die than to lose, it's a matter of time 'fore I lose it
And strategize with the movement-t-t-t-t-t 
Walk in the trap like a boss, ooh
Ho, you know I'm drippin' with the sauce, ooh
Pretty, with a face full of scars
All they did was build me up, tried to take me apart 
They ain't ever wanna celebrate like you have a label
Call the doctor, heard the chopper make 'em do the Macarena

All you niggas sweet as candy, chocolate chip and Now and Later
Jolly Rancher, stick of bubblegum, it's watermelon flavored 
Get the paper, I'ma  on the corner
Heard you niggas got the juice, but I got Corona
Got a little Spanish bitch, I call her maricona
Joyner Lucas, bitch, I'm hotter than a fuckin' sauna

Yeah, I make you niggas 
All you new niggas don't do it for me, look 
Bitch I'm the professor, you a student to me, woah
Designer shades on, like you cooler than me, wait 
All we do is win, you a loser to me
Rappers wanna talk about battle me 
You can't give me neck with a mouth full of cavities
Bunch of lil' niggas tried grabbin' me 
Five foot five, boy, you niggas like half of me
You don't wanna see the other side of me 
Hard to make 'em happy, all these bitches stay mad at me
I just might take her out to Applebee's 
Give her long dick and a strawberry daiquiri
Order Cheesecake Factory, bubblin', why you mumblin'?
What you utter? Stop stutterin', what you spend? Let me double it
Lime green 'Rari, two twins, call 'em double mints
If all you pussy niggas my kids, I'm in trouble then
Shut up 'fore I spank you for actin' up
Now I'm wakin' up in cabanas 'cause she bad as fuck
And all gorillas don't want bananas 'less your chain is tucked
You wiggity-wack with the strap, you cross Chris, make you jump
I criss-cross with the pump, ain't no bricks in the trunk
Leave that shit for the chumps, I still get what I want
Don't wanna believe in my mind, but you believe in my dump
I'm takin' a knee for my side, could give a fuck 'bout the owners
Nigga look at my eyes, you 'bout to give me my bonus
And every motherfuckin' record, that's a hit, I record it 
And e'ry motherfuckin' snitch up in this bitch, they report it 
You paid your way for this fade and can't even afford it
75 mil', look at me now 
And all these bad bitches can't keep their feet down 
You don't really wanna see Brown
Need to stop all that shit talkin', put the seat down
Joyner, I don't really feel these niggas
Hol' up, I ain't gotta pay to kill these niggas
Time is money, need to fuck around and bill these niggas
Vet, so I'm finna good will these niggas 

I'ma kill these niggas, I should grill these niggas
Take flex, Fresh Prince, Uncle Phil these niggas

Oh shit, I'm the shit, you could smell me, nigga
Break ribs, yeah, you don't want no real beef, nigga
I say As-salāmu ʿalaykum when I tear apart some bacon
Ho, you actin' like a pig, you fuckin' filthy, nigga

Now the police tryna lock me in the prison, said, ""I'm guilty""
I said, ""Da da da da da, come and kill me, nigga"" 
They must have forgot that I'm psycho 
Oh, you want war? Say no more
Turn your fuckin' block into a light show

You better be sure, better be sure
I'm the realest nigga that I know 
And I'm so bored, I might switch cars
I saved a lotta money on Geico

The neighbors knockin' on my door, what the fuck you want?
Bitch, I'm alright

Listen, nigga, mind your business, I'm so sick of niggas
Tellin' me how I been livin' my life

Sick of bumpin' shoulders, now I'm runnin' over
Every motherfucker who ain't wanna get in my ride

I was watchin', you was shoppin'
Ain't never had the shit in my size

Now I'm poppin', I'm poppin'
And your bitch keep hittin' my line
It's complicated, fuckin' up with my main bitch
Givin' it to the side bitch at the same damn time
Puttin' my face in it, never wastin' it
I'ma lay in it, hit it, hit it one more time
And I'ma proceed and play with the pussy
You know I don't keep my cape on a hoodie
But I keep a Uzi, it's a doozie, make a movie if you're actin' stupid

So my momma ain't want me, she got an abortion
I end up surviving this shit
And if I wanted somethin', I ain't got the money
I'd probably be robbing and shit
Don't know how much I cry for this shit
Said I am willing to ride for this shit
You know murder's my hobby, inside of my closet's a bunch of dead bodies and shit
Niggas say that I'm cursed 'cause I go to church and stare at the Bible and shit
Shawty say I'm the worst cause I do my dirt, and I don't be hiding this shit

Bitch, I'm a savage I spit at you bastards, I wonder what you gonna do to me, ho
I need to hear some more rapping
I'm just not impressed by your cash or your jewelry, ho
All you my soldiers and I'm a lieutenant
Goddammit, you should be saluting me, ho
I hope you know I ain't going nowhere
All you rappers just better get used to me, ho
Nigga, I'm
Mr. Blue
with my jeans, bought me a Jeep, 'cause I wasn't riding as much
My bank account looking weak, don't look at me, I ain't got time for no fun
Starting to feel like Tyrese, I'm 'bout to trip, and maybe start crying or som'
I might just hit up the Smith's, throw me a fit and wait for my wire to come
Ain't nobody give or show me love when I was coming up, I had to double up and tell these niggas buckle up before they ride
And they don't really wanna knuckle up, I hit 'em with the uppercut, I had these motherfuckers running for they life
Unidentified craft when I'm flying past, I'm an alien sailin' and if you look up in the sky
Blow your mind back, put your eyes back to your iPad, I'm an Iraqi in suicide
When the bombs are loaded and your mind explode in the wind
And you gon' sit down, repent
I was raised in the sewer; me and the 𝘐𝘵 clown are friends
Red balloons for your kids, sink my tooth in ya bitch
I lost too many friends, I don't do good with kids
What you know about riding dirty in the evening?
What you know about Ramen Noodles, and a pack of sazon seasoning
What you know about leaving the oven door open when there's no heat again
And the rent is due and your landlord try and throw you out on the streets again
Nigga, I was always dreaming of a Bentley and a fucking Lamborghini when I win 'em, I'ma finally get a break
If I didn't get it way before, I guarantee that if I talk to God, then I can say I got it when I prayed
She don't really want me to get petty,
turn a dime into a penny
, but she know I got a lot of shit to say
I can turn some water into Henny, drink it up and let the semi shoot, I'll pop you niggas all up in the face
Blood all up in the lake, I
Wanna see your wake die
They don't wanna wave bye
Creep when I came by, teeth like a canine
Bleed through your Levi, we from the East Side
Eat when the
beat's hot, tea from the teapot
Aim for the tree top, beg till your knees pop
Skrrt in a Nissan, swerve into three cars
You just a bird in a beehive, you just a cold in a room full of germs
Nigga, I said all of my idols and favorite rappers ain't been rhyming a lot
What the fuck happened to Jay Electronica? I wonder if he still got it or not
What ever happened to eLZhi?
What ever happened to Meth?
What happened to Beans?
What ever happened to Lauryn?
What happened to Banks?
Tell me what happened to Bleek?
What the fuck happened to Mos?
What happened to Missy?
Nigga, what happened to Ghost?
What ever happened to Cube?
What up with Common?
What the fuck, where did they go?
Tell me what happened to Budden's,
what about Luda?

Hope they get back to the music 'cause I need some new shit

Father, forgive me

I'm staring at this Bible as I keep glancing
Dear Lord, I got questions and I need answers
Tryna understand your vision, all I see is damage
Just a bunch of dead bodies in the street camping
A bunch of lost souls on their feet standing
We supposed to be your children, I thought we family
You're supposed to be my Father, bruh, I need answers
We don't need to die young, we just need chances
Tired of living on the edge so we keep scrambling
Tryna talk to these strippers but they keep dancing
We just wanna be number one like Steve Francis
Bow our heads, say a prayer, now the seed's planted
Everywhere I turn, I'm seeing MC's vanish
Lot of good niggas gone, I don't understand it
Lot of families lost and they sea stranded
I ain't tryna disrespect you, I just need answers
I know you're watching us from heaven thinking, ""Who to save?""
Cherry pickin' who should go next and who should stay
I'd be on my way to heaven if I knew the way
And bring back every good nigga you choose to take
They say you never wrong, but you done made a few mistakes
'Cause you taking the wrong niggas, maybe you should trade
Trade us back all the real ones, remove the fakes
I think you should trade
Give us 2Pac back, and take that nigga Suge 
Let the legend resurrect and he gon' live for good 
I been screaming ""Thug life"" in every different hood 
If only you could bring him back, Lord, I wish you would
Give us Biggie, give us Pun, give us Triple X
Take that nigga Trump with you, that's a bigger threat
There's too much power for a coward with no intellect
That's a bigot with a collar, there's a disconnect
Niggas dying, Mama crying, Grandma need a tissue
Niggas shootin' up a church, now I need a pistol
All them niggas still livin', you don't see the issue
But how you take Selena and then you take Aaliyah with you?
I ain't tryna disrespect, just need to meet up with you 
I ain't tryna overstep, just want to reason with you 
Give us back our loved ones and take the evil with you 
Send them suckers straight to hell, they don't need a vigil 
I need you to give us back Martin Luther, take Martin Shkreli 
Give us back Malcolm, take R. Kelly
R.I.P. Lil Snupe, give that boy his life back
Take Eric Holder, give us Eric Wright back
I'm sending you this message, Lord, I hope you hit me right back
They say I'm on the wrong train, I know I'm on the right track

'Cause Trayvon gone, and all he did was try to fight back
Zimmerman walk around free, we don't like that 
Why you take our mothers from us?
Our fathers and our sisters and our cousins from us?
Got these children getting murdered while they double dutchin'
Wonder why the fuck you take Nipsey Hussle from us?
Damn, you took a true king, a true brother from us
This a fuckin' marathon, but they runnin' from us
Now everybody got guns, niggas up to something
And every gangsta wanna prove that they tough or something
You know it's not fair, tell the truth, I've been in my feelings too
But if you took Emmett Till, at least take Dylann Roof
At least take James Holmes, I ain't even mad at that
Just bring back Whitney, and give us Michael Jackson back
Feds want me in the slammer, damn
Ain't no justice for Sandra Bland, we up like the ceiling fan
Lord, if you listenin', I'm just lookin' for a hand to hand
Take out the fuck niggas and give us back our fam again
Drownin' in my tears, tryna pray for something 
Wonder why you give us life for you to take it from us 
Wonder why you give us family then erase them from us 
Maybe hopefully you can have a conversation with us 
Maybe I'm just probably tripping 'cause I need a hug 
The hood can't find jobs, now we need a plug 
Everybody and their mama tryna be a thug
I don't go to church 'cause I'm afraid of being judged
I've been starin' at the ceiling as I lie in bed
Watchin' niggas follow trends like Simon Says 
I pray you give us back the real ones and try again
Or maybe take them niggas that deserve to die instead
Tomi Lahren run her mouth and then she get defensive
Laura Ingraham laughin' at death and disrespectin'
I really feel like you should teach them stupid hoes a lesson
Either that or give us back somebody who deserve the blessings
I left out a bunch of names that I forgot to mention
Cost too much to pay attention, then it got expensive
Father forgive me, for I know not what I do
And now I'm reachin' out to you, hopin' you hear me and return the message 
I know that you got our back and that you're not against us
Or maybe you just love us so you doin' shit to test us
I just kinda thought that you would do more to protect us
They say that the good die young and I ain't on the guest list
I've been drinkin', Lord forgive me, it's my blood racin'
I don't know what I'm thinking, I'm just frustrated
I don't mean to question you, I'm just confused
I don't know what else to do, I've been patient and it sucks waiting
Took my mans from me, that forever hurts
But puttin' the blame on you, that'd never work
I know this ain't your fault, it's the devil's work

All these losses I done took, I appreciate the wins
When your car cost two hundred you appreciate the Benz
Had a threesome with my bitch, I appreciate her friend
Cooper Street to my hood
, we gon' keep it in the fam nigga
Get chicken, I ain't never been a ham nigga
Got it out the mud, I ain't never did a scam nigga
RIP to all the fallen soldiers, free the fam nigga
Shut the fuck up if you ain't got a hundred bands nigga

Ayy shut the fuck up if you can't move a hundred grams nigga
I'm the man in here, residue on all the pans in here
Shit get ran in here, bitch I done blew a hundred bands this year
Ain't no cappin', if I get fucked up, bitch it ain't no rappin'

It's all action, if we gon' do it, do it with a passion
We ain't just rappin', we state the facts like we dispatchin'
These niggas dick suckin', they ridin' waves like a crew captain
Niggas lost they way 'cause with them ups, we done blew past 'em
Put these niggas on they back, get these boys a coffin
They ain't got no money, have 'em take it out the church offering
Left a hole in the nigga head like a sea dolphin
Every nigga in my team want bodies like an auction

Yeah Glock forty homie, I do no talking
Ten bands on your head, have my bro off you
Yeah, I only fuck with real niggas
6 Mile, East Warren, I'm with real hitters
Yeah clout chasing, nigga get your bitch fucked
On my way to Western U to get my dick sucked
Bitch head so weak, can't get my dick up
Yeah I don't want your bitch, come pick your bitch up
Bitch dick suckin'
Heard I shoot trips and swipe hair for bitches
Play with toys, rap, and get bows in, merry Christmas
Niggas know who to play with, ain't gotta tell these niggas
Hanging out the window, get to blowing like an air conditioner
Fuck it, hop out with that ratchet like the man on Cheaters
All these watches, all these pouches, feel like Jerry Springer
Can't name one bitch I can't fuck
Slow down baby girl, when you suck it ain't no rush
Bitch say she got a nigga, she look single through these buffs
Did a hark on that nigga, that shit really came in clutch
'Bout to pull up, rock a nigga's shit like he stuck
If it ain't 'bout no money, nigga shut the fuck up, nigga

A thousand beans in her pussy, have your bitch stuffed
Thirty racks on this Rollie, this bitch lit up
A nigga reach for this bitch, get his shit crushed
Twenty bottles on the way, light this bitch up
A nigga speakin' on my name, got his bitch fucked
I got some 6 Mile hoes, get your bitch jumped
If you ain't talkin' 'bout no money, shut the fuck up

Catch you slipping from the backside, then knock you out
Ace gon' stomp you out, then Buddah gon' stomp you out

Nine milli pokin' out, four-fizzy pokin'gout
Death Row days, show you what this West Coast about

I'd die for my motherfucking nigga
Jump in front a bullet for my motherfucking nigga
On the stand, I'd lie for my motherfucking nigga
Rob a bank, I'd drive for my motherfucking nigga, real talk
I don't really fuck with too many niggas
'Cause niggas drop a dime on you like a couple nickels
I be laughing to the bank like the fucking money tickle
Driving somethin' that you ain't, top off—suck a nipple
And I never put a ho before my bro, don't beef over no ho
And my niggas sell them keys if you can't open your door
Hope you ride for my motherfucking niggas
When it rains, it pours; it's dry for me and my fucking niggas, yeah
I kill for my motherfucking niggas, vice-versa
Eyes red from the kush I blew—white person
Got my middle finger on the trigger, and with my little finger to you niggas
I swear it's fuck all y'all niggas, except my niggas, oww!

I said, I'ma ride for my motherfucking nigga 
Most likely, I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
I've been grinding outside all day with my niggas
And I ain't going in 'less I'm with my nigga
My nigga, my nigga

Ohh! I done spent a million dollars on my motherfucking niggas 
You catch me out Chicago with them motherfucking hittas 
Call up RondoNumbaNine,
Lil Durk to bring the trigger 
And when we on the lean, we ain't fucking with the liquor 
I'ma buy a hundred bottles just to give it to the bitches 
She keep liking all my pictures
'Cause she see the way I ball, how my wrist and neck be lit up
Catch you at the red light, have 'em screaming, “Caine, get up!"" 
Same nigga from the bottom, ain't a damn thing change
C—C—Catch me out in Collins, screaming, ""Money ain't a thang""
In a red Mulsanne, looking like I claim Blood
And if homie ain't my homie, then I know it ain't love
Screaming out, ""4 Hunnid!” YG, that's my nigga 
'Cause I been in the field, life on the line, with him
And if it's really real, I'll prol'ly die with him
'Cause when I need the choppers, I just tell Tak, ""Hit 'em,"" what!
I said, I'ma ride for my motherfucking nigga
Most likely, I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
I've been grinding outside all day with my niggas

I just come through with a couple bossy bitches
They get money too, they some ""don't cross me"" bitches
Flossy bitches, Sergio Rossi, bitches
And if we at the game, then it's floor seat, bitches!
I—I—I—I—I—I ride for my bitches
I'm so fuckin' rich I cop rides for my bitches
Dollar menu, fries, apple pies: other bitches
I drop a freestyle and get a rise outta bitches
Bitches, my bitches
I need a nigga with some different strokes, Todd Bridges
Shout out to my main bitches and my side bitches
Need a nigga with some good neck, ostriches
My niggas
I said that I'ma ride for my motherfucking nigga
Most likely, I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
I've been grindin outside all day with my niggas
New York to Compton

Bicken back, bicken back being bool

Pull up on the block, like, ""What!""
Fuck the police, niggas better call the SWAT
I ain't never played with the pot
I was in your house tryin' to find a spot to extend my knots
I went to jail for a flock, came home with a strike
You went to jail as a bitch, came home as a dyke
Nigga, yikes! I don't play that shit
Wifey like SEGA; I don't play that bitch
I’m a real Bompton nigga with a motherfuckin' attitude
Walk up in the spot, you would think that a nigga mad at you
I was on the block chillin'; homies, what's the mission?
Came back in a quickness, hoping there wasn't no witness
And they came back shootin'
My homies went back shootin'
Ain’t nobody hittin' nothing, man, this shit getting stupid
And my homies with the news, so they grabbed that tool
This all started from a day of niggas bicken back being bool

I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back, bicken back

Verse two, the sun come down
You know when the sun come down them guns come out
Click clack, bow, bow bow bow bow bow
I used to rob niggas
That's probably why they try to rob my style
And karma is a motherfuckin' biatch
You got your homie in jail, you sniatch
All in the court telling the judge who it is
Like a bitch when you get to the pen, niggas on your wig
Niggas be lurkin', bitches be slurpin'
Niggas got caught up on them Nextels chirpin'
Did some months in the county, I ain't have no patience
My bitch wouldn't come see me, I was in there masturbatin'
Smoking on a bigarette, eating a bowl of bereal
Niggas on the block selling O's like Cheerios
Aye, nigga, nigga, nigga
I got a whole zone right now

Fuck with her, but don't fuck with her"

This young boy from Texas so excuse my grammar
Big booty my standards, D'USSE and Fanta
If I'm in the scene, I'm flexin' in the camera
Check my fellas, we all flock the same
We birds of the same feather
We together, this forever, switchin' bezels, every level

Me and Cinco push that two-door coupe
Ain't none of this shit rented
Servin' vicious, fuck your favorite rapper
Hope he get offended
I was trippin' off that hoe before but promise I ain't trippin'
I was trippin' off them Ksubi jeans but now my closet drippin'
Designer, got a bag and I couldn't be prouder 
Drop a song and your status went nada 
In the booth if I'm tryna get proper 
I was a schoolboy just tryna get collard greens
Homie outside with Alicia Keys
I make money from mics, they make money from fiends 
Root of all evil, what got me them tickets at Regal
So fuck what's illegal
I'm different, I really ain't get a handout
I know half of these rappers were gimmicks 
I write my own lyrics, I bought my own pen
All them O's buy my songs, screamin' ""Fuck your opinion""
No need for a nigga to say that I'm winnin'
It's fuck everybody, the way I been feelin'
I got me a bitch and my bitch got a bitch 
So they down for a threesome, nigga 

This young boy from Texas so excuse my grammar
Big booty my standards, D'USSE and Fanta
If I'm in the scene, I'm flexin' in the camera
Check my fellas, we all flock the same
We birds of the same feather
We together, this forever, switchin' bezels, every level

Switch a Lambo' for a Chevy, backseat heavy from that heavy
Want a bad bitch with the fetti, when she ready, bitch, I'm ready
Fuck the sex, I want that Becky, gimme Becky if you let me
I whip slow, my cook game steady, turn that boy into spaghetti
I could ask a partner in my camp to handle somethin'
They just do it like they beefin' with Adidas 
Bitches poppin' pussy for the same skinny nigga droppin' music
Ain't nobody have believe it 
Took a couple Ls, I ain't tweakin'
I got money to help all my reasons 
I got shorties from all major regions
I jumped in the water and claimin' the deep end 
Different money I'm countin' those shorties I'm poundin' on
I know them niggas is pissed
I'ma put a new Patek on by my bitch silicone
Then I'ma double again
Niggas ain't solid, I don't claim a friend
Because when I was knockin', you ain't let me in
Niggas lose vision all over the pussy
Respect the whole gang 'fore a blue Benjamin
Witness everyone say that I'm up
I was stuck at the bottom, you ain't give a fuck
I don't care for a bitch, I ain't searchin' for love
And I ain't trust a soul if he ain't from above
I ain't surfin' the wave, I got lost, fuck a brush
When I got in the game, I was shit out of luck
They would look at my pain and they ain't help me up
If you mention my name, say, ""I don't give a fuck""

Hotter than a sauna
I got more bucks, got more white than a bitch named Madonna
Lil' nigga, come check my status
Mike ain't never been average, I make it happen
Give me a bag, I'ma pack it
When I get mad, my chain get pissed
When I get sad, my ears shed tears
Been in the game three years
It's takin' a while 'cause' I'm pure
I'm better than them, I'm sick, no cure
Bonafide niggas don't have no fear
Rick Ross, my pants make me look like a pear
Madе two bands up in two minutes
My music make money slidе
When I leave, make bitches go suicide
When I got in the game, I got crucified
I ain't take no handouts, nigga
Why you got your hand out, nigga?
I'm flyer than any bird of a feather
You focused on bitches? Bruh, get it together
She tryna crease these lemon pepper steppers 
Almost put the ho on a strecher 
Got five missed calls, won't text her 
Lil' shawty always been extra 
This all-wheel drive, no Tesla 
I run this game, come catch up
Step on somethin' apply that pressure
Niggas mad, but I can't help 'em

I'ma just tell my story
This DLOG, no man above me
I wake up on bubbly
Niggas mad 'cause I get money
Leave my house, they tried to jump me
This no lie, this a true story
All I do is chase the glory
Me and fye like Rick and Morty

These niggas be pocket watchin'
Can't say shit, 'cause I'm twenty in the 2020 
Movin' work in that Challenger 
While your bitch givin' brain from the passenger 
Niggas can't keep up with me unless I let 'em
He gon' trust that bitch unless I tell him
Promise your homie is not your real homie
You think that's your homie? Then go 'head and test him 
Take her on a trip , put it on her lip 
Watch how young niggas get drip
I got some baby mamas tryna strip 
I got some young niggas tryna clip 
Thought we was homies, now you below me
It's funny that pussy can make niggas phony
It's funny that money can make niggas ho me, hold on 
But like I said, Double Lamb OG
All my niggas got beats, they eat
Yeah, Mike Dimes don't do no feats
Before one time, I slide G3
Yeah, my whip don't got no keys
Yeah, my bitch don't got no weave
All my niggas throw up L
But this no loss, this shit low-key
I get back, I get it back
I get a bag, I get a backend
I won't trip, 'cause I'm never lackin'
I get a brick and make it a fraction
I get it lit, I make it lit
I get it lit, I get it litty
Ain't no mark gon' have me slippin'
But this Glock gon' turn you to Ricky, that's on God
These niggas be fraud, these niggas don't rob
These niggas be talkin' 'bout all that cap 
These niggas be timid, these niggas ain't with it
I send him the addy, he gone off the map
I come through quick, come through quick
The minute you drops, make fiends relapse
This Glock my fan, this bitch gon' clap
I feel like NAV, I'ma tap, tap, tap
I'ma just tell my story
This DLOG, no man above me
I wake up on bubbly

Homie act cool on the drop

Got a little money, make a shorty act cool on a nigga
Half an hour, she'll be back with the opps 
I ain't get no love from my city
All a nigga wanted was some guap, I ain't ask for a lot

Brother told me if a nigga act tough, he gon' pop
I hit up Joe Biden, I need me a stimmy, my nigga 
They ain't fuckin' with me, my nigga 
I'm tryna get out of my city, my nigga
These boys tryna kill me, my nigga
I'ma go cop a 350 or a .380
Lifestyle been driving me crazy and I don't got time for the pussy
She think 'cause I'm paid, we can have a lil' baby 
Watch a young nigga composure, I get to the bag when I'm off of the sofa
I touched me a rack before I touched diplomas
I touched on her cat before I try to bone her
I did me a lot, I just did what I told 'em, uh 
Looking at me like I owe 'em, uh 
Looking at me like she know me
She think that she special, she don't know my motive

Run it up, breaking the bank, big boss
When I get in my bag, they get pissed off
Boy, I drink liquor, this shit ain't no crystal
I got a bitch and she suckin', her lips soft
We carry rockets, the gang finna lift off
Don't fuck with leeches, we takin' them ticks off
What can I say?
Niggas turn bitches when it come to the commas
P Diddy ain’t lyin', more money, more problems

Bet that bitch gon' make it clap to find a nigga with some guap

Go by two things in my lifestyle
Gang money and lose niggas
Everything start gettin' better, you gon' see they ain't even cool with ya
Bad bitches tryna fool with 'em, I don't want nothin' to do with 'em
Fake love, tryna make amends just 'cause of that lil' bitty trend on TikToks

R-in a my right side, well-a
Well-a, it's-a, Lordy, Ro-Lordy-Berta

Well, it's Lord, Ro-Lordy-Rosie
Well, it's, oh Lord, Gal, well-a

Uh, uh
Now let me know who be kickin' like Mike Dimes, nigga
I was spittin' bars before I knew I could rhyme, nigga
I was Father, Lord before there was father time, nigga
I was fuckin' broads before I was in my prime, nigga
Been the shit since I lеft my daddy's nuts
We pullin' caddies up for any nigga that be actin' tough
I nеver bragged enough, a city boy, I'm always actin' up
I'm takin' all her stuff, the nails, to weed
Designer bags and such, I know I been a klutz
Flow smoother than the slave ships, pay for writin' scripts
I'm like a bible that can move your hips, the land of holy shit
I say one thing, it start apocalypse, I like to give her tip
Don't fuck with niggas 'cause they all gon' flip, I never trip
'Cause niggas never really liked me
Point at anybody, bet they all would try to fight me
Prolly 'cause I left him or his bitch was getting pipe, B
I'ma say this once,  I don't want beef, not even slightly
Leave me alone, why every sentence start with ""My G""?

Ballin' like the latest Kobe Bryant of this rap shit
Nigga, I'm the greatest
Biggest flex to me is gettin' money on you haters
Love to make you niggas suffer, I'm a motherfuckin' sadist
Niggas talkin' shit but they ain't bringin' it to the table
Bitch, I'm tryna get this money, fuck a motherfuckin' label
I got children everywhere, I rock you niggas in the cradle
I ain't kiddin' with you niggas, I ain't motherfuckin' playful
Young nigga twenty, I'm tryna hit twenty mill'
And I'm eatin' good, I did had about twenty meals
Big body motor, see no big body wheels
This the H-Town drip, candy paint and golden grills
Bitch, I got the Tee with a little lemon squeeze
Bitch, I'm for the streets, I fuck a new bitch every week
Nigga, disrespect and you'll be drumming up a beat
Bitch, I'm on the track, that's that and family next to me

Go down, go down
Fly above yonder, and amen"

Can't walk with no nigga, can't walk with no bitch
'Cause a hoe is a hoe in my logic
My pockets from Houston, got rockets
My hoe is a check, she a profit
And I come through quick when I come through quick
No sorrow for niggas who crossed me
If he dead in my eyes or he dead in real life
Ain't no difference to me besides bodies and coffins
I'm a rеal nigga, not one for the dissin'
But half of thesе niggas be cappin' they disses
Claimin' they up but I look at the tracks
And these niggas be payin' to fake they positions

These niggas be cap, that's facts

Your niggas just talk 'bout the fellas 
The dash panoramic, for real
Fuck a deal, I'ma make me a deal
Get a mill' and a house on the Hills

The opps start comin' back, the thots start comin' back
With all these racks, I could just fuck around and break your mommy's back

She do it for gas and the Gs, thе P-I-M-P-S
She used to hate on me but now she lovin' me
Nah, my nigga, fuck that, she could not sit on this nut sack
Before the money start comin', in Mike wasn't nothin
They ain't give a fuck if I rap
They just talk about it, I been 'bout it, I was in the trap
The homie kicked me out 'cause I was gifted and they had to trap
We hopped in the car with the windows up, brodie gripped his clutch
I didn't think too much but homie in the back was tryna front
He said, ""Roll the window down, I'm tryna bump, my nigga""
He wasn't thinkin' 'bout the opps, just his blunt, my nigga

Had to cut off every nigga that was ever in my circle

Move in silence, leave the violence, that what Dom told me to do
If I speak on every blessin', they gon' try to take a move

Momma said, ""Don't ever ride"" with your windows down
'Cause if we do, we might just die with our windows down
Don't let them ever take your pride with your windows down
But we got the windows down 'cause we like the windows down
Ask them niggas, ""They gon' ride?"" 
Then nigga, you gon' die 
Could fuck around and lose your pride 
And we call it suicide and we don't like suicide
Ask them niggas, ""They gon' ride?""

Order '42 for the table, let’s pop shit
Missionary or doggystyle, I'ma top shit
Pussy-ass niggas hatin' on me from the closet, ah
Hoes tryna call me a snake, shit, I guess I can relate
'Cause a bitch spit a whole lotta venom
And since these hoes all rats, when they come around me
All I see is a whole lotta dinner
I walk around the house butt-naked
And I stop at every mirror just to stare at my own posterior
I don't give a fuck who talk behind my back
'Cause the bitch knew better than to let me hear her

Go to your place, no face, no case
Ninety-nine percent tint in a blacked-out Wraith
I remember hoes used to clap for me happily
Now I'm bossed up and them same hoes mad at me
Acting like they ridin', whole time tryna pass me
Watchin' me go through it and still tryna drag me

Look, I ain't even finna argue with a bitch

Miał mięśnie jak skały, fale się odbijały
Postura koszykarza, świat dla niego był za mały
Dziewczyny wciąż się przy nim śmiały, to lubił
Dziewczyny się przy nim nie śmiały odmówić
Tylko w jednym celu wciąż przemierzał kontynenty
Na Insta licznik się przekręcił, kiedy zrobił selfie
Dziewczyny mdlały, gdy niby niechcący puszczał ręcznik
Piłka, żeby mu się przyjrzeć, aż stanęła na obręczy

Ja nie dobieram słów, docieram do głów tylko tych co otwarte
Na trackach zawsze masz prawdę, i miej pewność też, że nie zamknę się
Jak do roboty za hajsem szedł, ten ReTo to było beką w chuj
A gdy chce mieć go za pasję, to już mendą jest i się sprzedał, cóż
O sprzedaży wiem wiele, w sieci znajdziesz dowody
Do wody wrzucam sieci, łapię płotki za ogony
Kurwy myślą, że na sezon wpadłem, a co to to nie
Kurwy, zbyt przyjemne dla mnie wasz ból dupy bym gdzieś szedł
Mówią newschoolom tu chodzi o cash, cash i to już nie rap jest jak chcą tylko kwit brać
A dinozaury na jednym patencie pierdolą dekadę was kurwa bez mydła
Ja doskonale wiem po co przyszedłem, sypiam spokojnie, z czystym sumieniem
Nie stać nas jeszcze by wejść w stały związek, ale jak gram to je mam na skinienie

Po wydanych płytach chcę mieć siano by mieć gdzieś sos
A jak mam się szczypać to sprawdzając czy nie sen to
Gram w otwarte karty by się nie ogrywać, mózg mam
Nigdy nic bez prawdy by móc nie omijać lustra

Możesz mieć najlepsze flow, i najlepszy miks
Nawet diamentowego mieć majka, ale nic nie zabrzmi lepiej niż prawda
Nie umiesz się przyznać do błędu, to ludzie do ciebie nie będą przyznawać się też
Już ci wariograf szaleje, a pierwsze pytanie nie padło nawet
Nie ma tu żadnego boga, ten jebany wymysł to fama i już
Ja też wierzę w to życie wieczne ale dla mnie gwarant to sława nie bóg
Prawda buduje i burzy, prawda rujnuje złych ludzi
Nieprawda zazwyczaj tych drugich, nikomu nie trzeba służyć
Każdy jest ziomkiem dopóki jest dobrze, a potem jest poczta głosowa lub skrucha
Mężczyzną jesteś jak dźwigasz na klatę twój syf, a nie się od niego odsuwasz
Najwięksi kłamcy najwięcej mówią o prawdzie zawsze, po tym ich poznasz
Ale karma zawsze kurwa jest bezlitosna

Ja nie dobieram słów, ja po prostu tylko mówię prawdę
I ust nie zamknę, wielkie sorry ziom
Tak wszystko co mam, to jedynie synek nóż na gardle
Więc tusz na kartkę, spływa z moich rąk
Brudna prawda, tylko ona może zmienić coś
Zmienić coś, odmienić los, zmienić coś
Brudna prawda, tylko ona może zmienić coś

To czemu z ekipą nie poleciał se jarać hasz do Maroko?
Chyba go ma, ale na scenę się wjebał, że wow
Na teledyskach ma bryle za dwa koła, szał, pewnie Queba mu dał
Nawijał też, że pół życia się musiał z chamami przepychać żeby sobie poszli
Tam gdzie się urodził to motylki w brzuchu ziom nie są oznaką miłości
Ja od zawsze nawijam prawdę i z dumą co rano podchodzę do lustra
Ty marny raperze odgrzewasz kotlety, twój tour bus to jebany food track
Musiałbyś stać się oszustem pajacu, żeby zrobić ze mnie oszusta
2k16 to dobry początek, coś jak śniadanie do łóżka

Quebonafide ziomek, ale jaka jest prawda?
Jestem Żydem, masonem i ajwaj, od dawna
Dziwne oko na dłoni i znaki przy skroni, sygnety, trójkąty na palcach 
Tańczysz walca z Azazelem czy jak, jak, walca z Lucyferem za high life
Walca z judzicielem,
ej dobra wystarczy, weź wracaj, oglądać ten
Zeitgeist
Też nie wierzę, we wszystko co widzę, we wszystko co słyszę nie dowierzam bratku
Ale nie rozkminiam, to sobowtór czy fidel
Bo życie zajmuje mi dosyć sporo czasu, więc nie jest tak, że nie zasnę
Bo szkielet na Marsie

doprawdy, na prawdę, zaprawdę i w prawdzie
Też miałem czkawkę i nóż na gardle

A ty to przeżywasz sam
Choć wokół takich chłopaków są setki
W miesiące zmienia się chwila refleksji
W kółko ten jebany żal
Ja tak tyrałem, żeby kupić majka
Oni, by mieli co włożyć do garnka
Niewykluczone, że byłbym tu z wami, wariaty
Gdyby nie ta jebana rap gra
Nie śpię se dobę, no bo wiem, że mogę
A jak dzieci płaczą tu, no to nie moje
Ty swoje widzisz jedynie na fotkach
A słyszysz tylko w telefonie
Wysyłasz dupie wszystko, co zarobisz
By niczego nie brakowało
Ona i tak w awanturze wypomni ci
Że to o wiele za mało, a ty

Patrzysz się na morze jak się z horyzontem zlewa
Dzwonisz do dupeczki ale nie odbiera tela
Może ktoś ją krzywdzi w tym momencie, a cię nie ma
Albo twoja miłość nie ma dla niej już znaczenia teraz
Patrzysz się na morze jak się z horyzontem zlewa
Dzwonisz do dupeczki, ale nie odbiera tela
Może ktoś ją krzywdzi w tym momencie, a cię nie ma
Albo twoja miłość nie ma dla niej już znaczenia teraz

Poznałem chłopaków w Anglii, Leicester
Do dzisiaj się z nimi trzymam
Byłem tam, żeby zagrać dla nich koncert
A nie co rano gdzieś zmywać naczynia
Każdy z nich ode mnie młodszy
Mówią, że raczej nie wrócą do Polski
No bo w ich miastach się dzieje masakra
O legalnych hajsach to, ziomek, zapomnij
Oni co dzień noszą w sobie smuty grube
Pierwsze kroki dziecka widzieć na Youtubie
Jest ciężko, a nie? Nawet kamień by uronił łzę
Mówisz, że Ziemia to jebany czyściec
Przeżywasz piekło i czujesz nienawiść
Inni tu boją się o tym pomyśleć
A ty sam codziennie sobie z tym radzisz
Do celu lecisz bez wizy
To ty jesteś królem, nie Beezy
Ja tylko chcę dać trochę siły tym ludziom
Bo bardziej na nią zasłużyli niż ja
Moi rodzice tak żyją X lat
Moi znajomi tak żyją X lat
Widzę ich smutek jak znowu po świętach
Tam jadą po przeklęty, jebany hajs
Liczę, że kiedyś powrócą na zawsze
Będziemy mogli się bawić jak dawniej
Dla nich chcę zarabiać grubo na rapie
Na próżne zachcianki straciłem zajawkę
Chcę z nimi siedzieć na ławce
Nie jebanym Skypie, znasz ten ból?
Gdzie byście nie byli, mordy
To mam was w sercu, będziecie zawsze tu!
Patrzysz się na morze jak się z horyzontem zlewa
Dzwonisz do dupeczki ale nie odbiera tela
Może ktoś ją krzywdzi w tym momencie, a cię nie ma
Albo twoja miłość nie ma dla niej już znaczenia teraz
Patrzysz się na morze jak się z horyzontem zlewa
Dzwonisz do dupeczki, ale nie odbiera tela
Może ktoś ją krzywdzi w tym momencie, a cię nie ma

BIA,Esta Noche by BIA (Ft. Ariana Grande),"
To wszystko było tak łatwe, jak beef z Aspiratio
W końcu dostałem nominację - jak DiCaprio
Gdybyśmy chcieli się tylko postarać, życie być mogło filmem
Ale łatwiej niż coś naprawiać było ściągnąć Tinder
I znowu mam nową parę, potem znowu mam nową parę, babe
Jak sneakerhead, bo potrzebuje Cię mała jak Starków Winterfell
Albo nie, to tylko chwilowe impulsy mnie męczą
Chwi-love, ta jebana miłość się staje obsesją!
Czuliśmy razem się luźno wszędzie, nie myśleliśmy co jutro będzie
Byłem bohaterem w twoim domu, kiedy śrubokrętem
Otwierałem wino, do dzisiaj masz w oku łezkę pewnie
I ze smutną miną w samotności gapisz się w Messenger
Ale ja chyba jestem pierdolnięty
No bo lepiej mi, gdy się męczysz, wtedy naprawdę lżej mi
Krzyczysz, że to boli chamie, no bo wybrałem poligamię
Idź powiedz, że boli mamie, naprawdę fajnie, że dzwonisz, ale...

Nie ma mnie dla Ciebie, jebać przeznaczenie
Wszystko się zmienia, dla Ciebie nie mam już miejsca
Nie mam go, nie mam go, nie mam
Siemanko, siemanko i siema!
Nie ma mnie dla Ciebie, jebać przeznaczenie
Wszystko się zmienia, dla Ciebie nie mam już miejsca
Nie mam go, nie mam go, nie mam
Siemanko, siemanko i siema!

Przejechałem się na Tobie ziomek, jak monster truck
Na którego drodze stał zaledwie domek z kart
Weź sobie ten toksyczny związek, jak Walter White
Teraz ona siedzi sama i ty sam gdzieś on-line
Zmieniłeś mi status na jej ex, tacy byliście zżyci
Wróciłeś na Ziemię jak SpaceX, kumając, że z lovki nici 
Kiedyś dałbyś sobie za mnie uciąć rękę, braciszku sprytny
A dziś żeby z kimkolwiek być chwytasz się brzytwy
Zawsze Cię bolał cudzy hajs w kieszeniach i sukces
Przez to się w Twoich nóż otwierał, może dlatego wciąż bywały puste
Może dlatego już nie masz ziomali, prócz paru nowych znajomych na przypał
W sumie to pięknie się żeście dobrali, bo też pałami są w innych ekipach
Stoisz na pobojowisku walki z samym sobą
Zadzwoń do mnie, jeśli potrzebujesz rad i polon
Pierdolisz mi coś o wspólnym melanżu
Z tego co słyszę, to już robisz balet
Super, że dzwonisz z okazji urodzin, żeby się ze mną pogodzić, ale...
Nie ma mnie dla Ciebie, jebać przeznaczenie
Wszystko się zmienia, dla Ciebie nie mam już miejsca
Nie mam go, nie mam go, nie mam
Siemanko, siemanko i siema!
Nie ma mnie dla Ciebie, jebać przeznaczenie
Wszystko się zmienia, dla Ciebie nie mam już miejsca
Nie mam go, nie mam go, nie mam
Siemanko, siemanko i siema!"

Przez ludzi, których nie widzimy dziś 
Przez słowa, których nie powinno być 
Przez grzechy, których nie możemy zmyć 
Płynę z tym ścierwem ulicami jak przez Ganges
Oni myśleli, że to przerwę - prędzej padnę
Mam jedno miejsce w piekle pewne tak jak Dante
I nigdy więcej nie chcę widzieć siebie na dnie
Przez ludzi, których nie widzimy dziś 
Przez słowa, których nie powinno być 
Przez grzechy, których nie możemy zmyć 
Płynę z tym ścierwem ulicami jak przez Ganges
Oni myśleli, że to przerwę - prędzej padnę
Mam jedno miejsce w piekle pewne tak jak Dante
I nigdy więcej nie chcę topić się w tym kłamstwie

Cały syf z mojego życia dziś zalewa łeb mi
Nie jestem tu nowy, więc przestań przyczepiać mi metki
Ludzie mówili: ""o kurwa, narkoman się uniezależnił"" 
Myśleli, że dalej popłynę z tym syfem jak Ganges
Jak Ganges, bo niejeden chłopak się tutaj poświęcił
Chciał dobrze, niestety na zawsze utonął w tym kłamstwie
Utonął i zrobił sam ze swojej świątyni śmietnik
A miał ludzi, co wiele dla niego przeszli jak Ganges
Tu biedni udają bogatych, a bogaci dobrych
Że nic nie osiągnę bez pracy coś pierdolą mi bananowcy
Choć moje życie to ciągle stres
I nie wierzę w Boga, to i tak codziennie, chłopaku się modlę przez

Mam jedno miejsce w piekle pewne tak jak Dante
I nigdy więcej nie chcę topić się w tym kłamstwie

Mamo, ja ciebie przepraszam najbardziej
Przeze mnie łez więcej wylałaś niż Ganges
Prawie nie było mnie w moim pokoju
Za bardzo byłem skupiony na walce
Z prądem płynąłem 
Rzucałem prochy 
To temat rzeka 
Wiara w to życie wysychała co dzień 
Ulica żyje 
Święta i brudna 
Paru wchłonęła 
Ale paru ludziom dała nowe życie 
I popłynęli 
Ja, typie, jebię melanże
Już się nie nadaję do picia jak Ganges
Choć moje życie to ciągle stres
I nie wierzę w Boga, to i tak chłopaku codziennie się modlę przez
Przez ludzi, których nie widzimy dziś
Przez słowa, których nie powinno być
Przez grzechy, których nie możemy zmyć

BIA,月亮代表我的心 (Yue Liang Dai Biao Wo De Xin) by 鄧麗君 (Teresa Teng),"
Ty zostaniesz, inne wyjdą stąd rano
To różnica między dziwką, a damą
Kiedy nie ma cię to jest załamka
I czuję się jakby mi wszystko zabrano
Chętnie byśmy na serio zaczęli
Bo tak wiele nas łączy, choć dzieli nas wszystko
Jesteśmy dla siebie stworzeni
Czuję, że to miłość, to nie jest hip-hop i fame
W głośnikach leci T-Pain, się nie wstydź, odpalaj ten flakon i lej
Za lepsze czasy, co właśnie nadeszły, nie stare momenty jak Big Daddy Kane
My zawsze razem będziemy szczęśliwi, nigdy nie wypuszczę cię z imprezy złej
Kocha mnie za to, że jestem prawdziwy i za to, że mam IQ wyższe niż jej
Dlatego nie ma między nami kłótni, kiedy wszyscy wokół sobie opijali smutki, my nie
Odrzuca nas ten udawany luz ich
My chcemy chamówki, nalewamy wódę w kubki i jeb
Nie ma dla nas ograniczeń żadnych 
Nawet jakbyśmy najebani wpadli, okej
Zakładam bandanę, piracki mam swag
Ona się ociera o mnie jak statki o brzeg
Śmiejemy się z par co chodzą napięte i niszczą relacje na własne życzenie
Ona szuka opiekuna, on szuka służącej, no niestety takie myślenie
Raczej nie skończy się porozumieniem, a kolejnym wspólnie zjebanym wieczorem
My idealnie się uzupełniamy, gdy razem nad sobą tracimy kontrolę, znów

Wychodzę z nią na miasto, nie po to, żeby się całować pod latarnią
Podbija do niej jakiś lamus, mówi faux pas, łajzo
Otwieramy browar o krawężniki, lekko podpity chce palić spliffy
Popijać z nią wódę bez popity, skończyć najebany nie pobity
Wychodzi ze mną na miasto, nie po to, żeby się pochwalić koleżankom
Bo prędzej bym zrobił bagno i jeszcze naubliżał policjantom
Ale nie wstydzi się mnie, nawet nie brzydzi się mnie
Jak rzygam pijany pod klubem, czuję się dla niej wybrany to lubię
Tracimy kontrolę

Spokojna maniurka na co dzień, lecz gdy trzeba, budzi się wulkan tam w tobie
Wpadasz na wino, konsolę, furę dziś zostawiasz pod domem i luźno odpuszczasz kontrolę
Odpuszczasz kontrolę jak gdyby wjechała skarbówka i dostała w łapę sos
I z urzędu należy nam się jedynie odpinka, to summer love
Kocham te twoje dwie twarze i nie to, że Harvey Dent flow czy siostrę syjamską
Masz wiedzę kozacką i dobrze wiesz kto to był Monet, Picasso i Louis i Armstrong
Nie lubisz przytaknąć, jeżeli nie zgadzasz się na sto, to będzie dyskusja
I będzie wyluzka dopiero, gdy dojdziemy do tego, co nas poróżnia
A dzieli nas wiele i łączy nas wiele i przez to nas tak właśnie ciągnie do siebie - magnes
Trzy shoty w Aferze, czwarty nam Pelson poleje w gratisie
- transfer
Nad Wisłę Uberem
, mamy dziś siebie, po piwie w zapasie
Żadne, brać krechę na krechę, nikt z nas do lustra po drodze nie zajdzie
Przez tamkę na Powiślu, nie Tampę na Florydzie
Nie mam łajby na Marinie, ale luźno nam czas płynie
I nawet jak widzę cię rano zaspaną, zmęczoną i niewypindrzoną
To choć nie jesteś idealna, to jesteś jak demokracja, nic lepszego nie wymyślono
Wychodzę z nią na miasto, nie po to, żeby się całować pod latarnią
Podbija do niej jakiś lamus, mówi faux pas, łajzo
Otwieramy browar o krawężniki, lekko podpity chce palić spliffy
Popijać z nią wódę bez popity, skończyć najebany nie pobity
Wychodzi ze mną na miasto, nie po to, żeby się pochwalić koleżankom
Bo prędzej bym zrobił bagno i jeszcze naubliżał policjantom
Ale nie wstydzi się mnie, nawet nie brzydzi się mnie
Jak rzygam pijany pod klubem, czuję się dla niej wybrany to lubię

Two year relationship, that nigga really owe me

Bitch, I want my time back, bruises, had to hide that
I thought I was pregnant, to this day, I'm thanking God for that
Fuck The Rap Game, still happy I ain't sign that
No sleep, when I land, headed straight to sound check
Dropped ten bands to beat a case that I ain't do 
How the fuck they book me for some shit with no proof? 
Bitch, I ain't forgot how y'all was clownin', but it's cool
I'ma sue and get the last laugh on 'em when I'm through
I love my OG, but he ain't show me how to treat shit
No wonder why I let that nigga try me like a weak bitch
Shouldn't have made the tape, he keep on threatenin' to leak shit
I let a nigga break me, now I'm pickin' up the pieces 
She used to be my dawg, but now she telling all my business 
If I could take it back, I wouldn't have been on television 
'Cause y'all won't let me grow up and accept the fact I'm winning
Brother in the penitentiary, it's a piece of me missing 
Heart been broke way too many times 
Me and
Brooke
beatin' bitches, still banned from Mount Zion
I can't let the industry get between me and mine
Swear I'm trying not to lose it, but this shit be havin' me crying
Mama had me at fifteen,

I came home from school and seen bags, hella drugs
Lost the bond with my daddy for some money and a buzz
Swear the industry the devil, shit, it is what it was
Ain't no stranger on the 'net finna tell me 'bout my life, though 
As a kid, feelin' too black for the white folks
Ain't changin' my name, disagree and you can die slow

We can shoot it out or just beat a bitch 
They say I'm gettin' thick, ""What you eatin' sis'?""

Single again, I'm back on the prowl
So they in my DM tryna take me out
I tell a nigga, ""No,"" like Simon Cowell
I ain't playin' fair, they callin' fouls
Tell that nigga, ""Beat it,"" like he on trial
I'm a rapper, but I look like a model
Bitch, I'm poppin' like a motherfuckin' collar
Super stingy with the kitty, these hoes passed around like a dollar
Wifey did the ice, ayy, chain

Swear I really got that super soaker, baby, we can go all night 
Told that nigga that I really rap, baby, I can rock yo' mic, ayy

Fuck around and tap Kyrie on the shoulder when I'm sitting courtside, ayy
On Instagram, he got a blue check, but do he got one in real life 
'Latto goin' let them hoes know
I hit the shoe box when the bank close
When shit get real, half of 'em goin' fold like some damn clothes
Grew up 'round niggas like Alicia, they was moving keys like pianos
Fuck me good, hit a high note
Got me singin' like soprano
Ayy, I keep the pole like a stripper
Bob the Builder with the tool, ayy
He done fell asleep in this ocean, make a nigga think he on a cruise
Ayy, I gotta chill, I got shit to lose
Call me BlocBoy, know I'ma shoot
Never been the type to talk it out, I ain't never goin' call a truce
Aye, I get more head than a du-rag
I get a check and run through that
And my new nigga from New Orleans
I got all of these bitches like, ""Who that?"" 
Pull up, they like, ""Where the roof at?""
Stay by his side like a blue flag
Got his back like a book bag
I took yo' nigga, that's too bad
I just flewed out and I flew back"

Helluva made this beat, baby

These niggas prayed on my downfall 
These niggas prayed on my downfall
On all ten, bitch, I stood tall
Show these disloyal niggas how to ball

Go get a thermometer for the pot, I need this shit cooked right
Let's keep that water 400 degrees Fahrenheit
You ever been inside a federal court room?
Nigga you ever went to trial and fought for your life?
Bein' broke did somethin' to my spirit
Asked niggas to plug me, they act like they couldn't hear me
Look at me now, drivin' German engineering
You don't want your baby mama fucked, keep the ho from near me
Kilroy, 'member when I used to use your L's
To hit the road, hit the O and make them big boy sales?
Mu, 'member when you had them green things mailed?
With vacuum seals, tryin' not to have them green things smelled?
Feds was on me, what you know about related through money?
I don't know nothin', I just used to see 'em walk to the Coney
I fuck with bitches, my body count go from Pershing to Cody
Any further questions, you can take that up with the lawyer
My nigga Fenkell, J Money, Brightmo Lo, Project Joe
Will tell you every day before school I sold a half bow
How you think I won best dressed with no support?
And had them paid lawyers comin' in and out of court
Ayy, Dwan, though, ayy, Theo, ain't it a blessing?
We made it out Kentucky after all that happened?
After the pre-trials, after the status
After them impact statements, after the castle

Ayy, JR, nigga, ain't it a blessing?
We made it out of Lansing after all that happened? 
After Michigan State, after Hubbard
When our mans told on us, them bands they took from us
Joy road bitch, but the money long as six mile
Brick mile, knock your bitch down
Pick her up, knock her back down, pull her tracks out
Yes I slap girl, yes I slap dog, yes I slap loud
Yes I'll slap a pussy nigga if he act out
Yes I caught cases on the road with them killers
Bro, kill me if I snitch, 'cause if you snitch I'm gon' kill ya
Spent a lot of time on that yard with them gorillas
Stood tall, did I let niggas ho me? Quit bein' silly
I know for a fact your bitch pussy get wet for a nigga
'Cause I do it better, plus I'm doin' better than niggas
I'm at home when I'm down there in Lexington nigga
'Bout the king, they gon' drop you and who next to you nigga
Unc said Lil T, ""Get ahead of them niggas!""
When you take off, don't look back and try to rescue them niggas
You killed his mans? Then make sure you get the rest of them niggas
Don't let them get the best of you, just get the revenue nigga
So let me know what you can handle, okay, come grab it
Here go some extras, so if I'm busy you can manage
Fiends had me Blade dancin', eating sixty dollar salads
Get it there and back, tell the feds I need a challenge
My first offer was 30 years, not a day lower
I told them crackers holler at me when they sober
On parole, I'm a felon,
you think I ain't got that blower?
Yeah you right, bro take his head off his fuckin' shoulders

You hear me? Hit the Rollie store with the Rollie on
What was our getaway car? A Jag Portfolio
You hear me? Ayy, I heard I had some sneak dissers
Whoever feelin' hot, that AR got a heat sensor
Cuz said don't entertain them hungry niggas
I wish I would pay attention to these homeless niggas
Don't call my phone, I don't want to do no song with niggas
And tell yo bitch to tighten up before I bone her, nigga
I don't know you niggas, fuck wrong with niggas?
Through these white buffs I can see the ho in niggas
Free my nigga
Parico
, that boy be hoein' niggas
Shoot the smile off your face, I don't joke with niggas
Boy, I can't trust you with that strap if you ain't got no bodies
Boy, I can't take you on no lick if you ain't robbed nobody
You ain't no shooter, you can't do that shit without no molly
I came home and had the hoes wetter than Kalahari
Thirty months ago niggas ain't think that I was comin' home
Shout out to them niggas' freaks that I been cummin' on
Get 'em to the crib, bust 'em down, now bitch run along
This SK'll get to shakin' like there's somethin' wrong
Thirty bands two times, watch this money clone
The feds say my name hot like when the oven on
Bitch, I came home to my lil' brother gone
Niggas say they lookin' for me, pull up in the Skuddy zone
Who said I'm a snitch? You just heard a lie from him
Better check the black and white
That paperwork will vouch for him
Zero toleration for that nigga, take his life from him
He don't want that pistol play? Okay I'll Tyson him
I ain't hear from bitches when I had them blues on
So soon as I'm done fuckin', put your shoes on
I'm on parole in two states, I can't move wrong
The feds tryin' to build a case, I can't move wrong
I went to trial back to back, bitch, I'm 2-0
The state of Kentucky banned me from every jewelry store
Say I can't even be in public with my hoodie on
Michigan State don't want him here, they don't know what he on
I know they prayed on my downfall
I know they prayed on my downfall

Just fucked a ho out in France, paint her face like Picasso
I iced out my vatos, I'm really up 
Big ass Bimmer, big Benz, and my Bentley next 
Don't play around on my phone, ho, give me sex
Watch on my wrist out of date, but it's Rolex
Grizzley up next, I'm up now, strap your bullet vest

Five-hundred fifties, six-hundred hundreds
Seven-hundreds twenties, let's get straight to it
Eight-hundred tens, what's that, eight bands?
Hit the store and get some rubber bands, let's get straight to it
Everybody come together, everybody got the plan
He came with you, so if he steal, it fall on you, we on your ass
Have your mans call his mans, make sure they ain't movin' fast
Soon as they touch Atlanta, get with Boat
,
secure the bag, nigga

Uh, oh, a bag secured, that's on my mama, bro
Asian lil' ho, she ride that dick, Yokohama flow
Made that shit double, got an Uzi, I don't scuffle
Not a banger but that banger in my car like an airbag
Niggas only aimin' in the sky, call those Air Mags 
All up in Neiman's, coppin' shit, like, fuck a price tag
I'm ballin', ain't near a rap nigga in the game that I'm callin' 
If I need help, I'll dial it by my se-kelf

You swear your bitch faithful, she sent her location
I hit her at the trap in Decatur, she basic 
Chop with the laser, get decapitated 
Can't smoke, I'm on papers, hold on, this my Jamaican 
Niggas want me dead, so I'm steady prayin'
Ain't no disrespect without retaliation
Fuck a hotel, I hit her in the basement
Text her later like, ""I'm done with you, I got a situation, baby""

Hmm, well shit, bro, let me get her then 
I'ma dog her out then switcheroo into the lion's den 
Nigga talkin' down, my bro got more heat than a fryin' pan 
Gucci 'round my hair, wrapped tight like I'm Taliban
Like I'm Taliban, how we drop shit 
Lot of dreadheads, lot of chopsticks 
Touch my nigga Yachty, get your top ripped 
Don't ask the price if you know you ain't tryna cop shit

You the type to look around but never cop shit, ayy
I'm the type to buy the store, make them restock it, ayy
Beam on everythin' I own, I will not miss 
Grizzley by my side like a pilot ridin' cockpit 

Yachty, I might stop rappin' for this one reason 
If the Feds hear this shit I'm doin' a hundred seasons 
In the hood, shootin' craps in my Yeezys
Put angels on you niggas who be playin' like y'all demons
You dig?

Middle finger to them niggas hatin' and fakin'
They plottin' on my death, I give their mothers deep penetration
This diamond choker for some reason give me pure ventilation
Every real nigga livin' will respect this collaboration 

We the bust down brothers, check the Rollies out
Say you winnin' one more time, I'm pullin' trophies out
Niggas know we out, no Shaqs, all Kobes out
In other words, I'm with all shooters that'll blow you down 
From the D to the A, put respect on it 
If that's your ho, why my dick got her mouth on it? 
I'm from the south, I got diamonds in my teeth
I got fur on my fleece, my new ring could pay your lease


Chain on my dresser next to my indictment
When they said not guilty I was so excited
From the A to the D, bitch you heard Yachty

I know that Lil Trell comin' home
But they give Lil D fifty years
His mama keep cryin' them tears

Better do what you do, better run, or skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Boy, you better run
Lil' Melly comin' for ya
And he strapped up with the gun
An anaconda in your circle, and you don't even know

And where was she when a young nigga was so damn broke?
And where was she when a nigga ain't have no hope? Huh

This bitch wanna fuck, she rollin' my blunts
I don't even smoke, you like to toke
We totin' the tommy gun, got free smoke for anyone
Nowadays, niggas change for the fame
Niggas switch on the gang, then come and try to hang with us
He was just rich two years ago
Now the nigga in the middle of the road on angel dust
We ain't had shit, we was on our dick
And them hoes ain't even really wanna hang with us
Niggas switch on some snake shit, fake shit
Hell nah, pussy ass nigga, that ain't what's up
Nigga fuckin' with the crew, say he really with the shit

Called my plug like, ""What bag I'm 'bout to catch today?"" 
I got 200 on that Rolls, you can't catch the Wraith 
I'm in love with my bitch ass cheeks 
Told that hoe my lap was her assigned seat 
He gon' choke her out if he found out I had her chokin' 
And my watch mil', you will drown, my AP the ocean 

Eskeetit!
Bitch, don't call me Pump, my name Jetski 
Million dollars cash, just layin' in the bedsheets 
All your jewelry fake, boy, that shit don't impress me 
Got a AP, sip lean, don't drink Henny 
Tag team a bitch pass her to the bro 
Ex-bitch a hoe, had to let her go 
Had her suck my dick for a line of coke 
Spent twenty thousand on a rain coat

Twenty on my gucci fit 
Yeah I got a thick bitch , all you niggas counterfeit 
Spanish hoe she with the shits , I put ten bricks on a Lyft 
Too much hoes I cannot pick , don't know which one I should hit 
I might fly the jet to Waikiki 
3500 for the sweater 'cause it's GG 
Hit her in the shower, made that lil' bitch do the mini-me
Me and Jetski drippin' on a bitch, neck on Fiji 
Watch really hittin', ain't no funny camera tricks 
Gettin' chewed up by my lil' hispanic bitch 
No you can't spend the night, don't bring your pajamas bitch
And whoever don't like it suck a dick with extra spit, bitch

Loved each other way more than we loved life
Was so close, people thought we had a love life
We loved each other way more than we loved life
Helluva made this beat, baby
Still do 

I used to be like, ""I don't need security"" 
I don't want these niggas thinking that it's fear in me 
Told my driver, ""Be on point,"" he wasn't hearing' me 
Those shots went off, I'm steady callin', you ain't answerin', you scarin' me 
In my city, if you winnin', you can't stay
They call bein' broke, ""Real,"" they call gettin' money, ""Fake""
I gave you a bitch, why you still lookin' at my date?
I gave you some food, why you still lookin' at my plate, nigga?
They say they love us, but that love might be hate
I can't really tell the difference, salt and sugar look the same

Look how they did Dex
,
look how they did Blade 
Look how they tried to do me, but got JB
Man, that jealousy so real, man, that hate so deep
Man, that envy shit so real, you make it out these streets
You saw it wasn't me and still shot, what she do to you? 
We was just winnin', now I'm cryin' at your funeral
But every tear I shed another thousand on your head, nigga 
Now show your face and think I'm playin', nigga
Every tear I shed another thousand on your head, boy 
Now show your face and think I'm playin'
Ayy, JB, I wish I was sittin' outside with you
And I was in that bank with you
You know your favorite rapper wouldn't have never let them guys get you
I would've shot 'em, left 'em dyin', leakin' in the street
Wouldn't have ran, would've smoke the Runtz and watch that man go to sleep
And you think they came for her? Man, you know they came for me
They took my heart and my brains, niggas know that I can't think
How I'm playin' with these drums, niggas know I'm like Tay Keith
Eyes bloodshot red, niggas know I ain't been sleepin'
But all these dead loved ones make it hard to sleep 
All this anger inside make it hard to grieve 
Ayy, all this nicotine make it hard to breathe 
All these tears in my eyes make it hard to sleep 
They found a murder weapon, bro, it's gon' be hard to beat 
First offer fifty years, so it's hard to plea, ayy 
And if they do somethin' to us, then they known for it 
But if we do somethin' to them, then we wrong for it 

Fuck that, if you take mines, I take yours, homie 
Then gon' pray to the Lord, ""Don't be too hard on me"" 
Yeah, you drop one, I drop four, homie 
They be like, ""God, please don't be too hard on me"" 

If we tear this bitch up, they gon' say I'm dead wrong 
Fuck that, these niggas got my auntie with a headstone 
Niggas tellin' me what to do like they smart as me 
But they ain't take your heart from you, they took my heart from me 
I got one less person that wanted more from me
Ready to kill whoever play with me or shorted me 
I got your kids, I got Nanni, I got Nell too
I got your babies, Kee and Zi and Gabrielle too 
I got your sister and your mommy and your fam' too 
How the fuck you gon' die on me? I can't stand you 
I pray they don't go to jail, I want 'em dead
I'm just listenin' to the streets, hearin' everything they sayin'
I'm just waitin' on a name, I'm just prayin' that they say it
Give a fuck if it's the Mayor, nigga, million on his head, ayy, ayy 
Wish I could wake you up and beat your ass
'Cause I was just tellin' you about them dreams I had 
Ayy, niggas snatched my heart out my chest, can't nobody replace it
Wouldn't have ever believed you was fuckin' with your baby
""Make sure Tee good"" is all I ever heard you sayin'
Tryna hold my head, I don't know if I'ma make it 
This shit been eatin' me 
I don't know what you seen in me, but you believed in me 
Tell them ""Keep that fake love, let me grieve in peace"" 
You drop mines, I drop yours, homie 
You drop one, I drop four, homie 
Then be like, ""God, please don't be too hard on me"" 
God, please don't close the door on me "

What your jewels cost? What that coupe cost?
I need two vaults, I'm the new Hulk

Too much money, I need like two vaults 
Stacks big and green, I call my pockets the new Hulk
We don't pay attention to no loose talk 
Shoot that choppa hundred times, I had to let it cool off 
Diamonds dancin' on me, doin' the moonwalk 
Can't wear my AP, I had to let it cool off 
Almost died from pneumonia, had to take my jewels off 
We don't argue with these niggas, we just let them tools talk 

Hit your bitch and give her back, now she yours again 
Back to back in them Ferraris, we stay horseplayin' 
Run up on us and the morgue gon' have corpses in
Harvard student doin' my taxes, I got dork friends
I put rings on them hundreds, bitch, I married them 
You see my niggas, money and ice everywhere on them 
And we fuck each other's hoes 'cause we don't cherish them 
But we don't leak out that info, we can't embarrass them 
Can't leave the country, but I got my beat from London 
These niggas talk but see me out and ain't on nothin' 
I'm in the stu, I need a Perc', go get the runner
You got shooters, I got hunters, you got twenties, I got hundreds, nigga

These niggas plastic, y'all as real as Buzz Lightyear
Nigga say he got that dope, then what the price is? 
I don't drink, but it's for sale, we got pints in 
We got Tech in , we got Act' in 
.45 bullets jammed in that MAC-10 
They don't check none of the artists, so I'm packin' 
It's a problem, then you'll see me get crackin' 
Addy 212, bitch, what's brackin' 
I might be in the Escalade but I ain't lackin' 
Put that bag on you, act like I don't know what happened 
I hear the story, be like, ""Damn, that was tragic"" 
Too much money, I need like two vaults

Yeah, yeah, Lil Boat, ayy
I'm still under 21, so I can't cop a pistol 
But them choppas in my name and they can't wait to hit you 
Crib came with a court and some league officials 
Carrot cake around my neck, VS1 the crystals
Extended magazines , chauffeured limosines 
Before I dropped out, I fucked the daughter of the dean 
65 thousand dollars in a nigga's jeans 
Ball like Sefolosha , skrrt the Testarossa 
Nigga all about the guap like a stock broker 
Brother with me and he shootin', no Dan Folger

Every bitch I ever fucked with was mad older 
Had to keep this shit player like the OG Yoda 
Lil Boat
Too much money, I need like two vaults 
Stacks big and green, I call my pockets the new Hulk

Fight the cases, I hope y'all beat 'em
You ain't gotta say you real if you real I can see it

Everybody ain't loyal, everybody ain't street
Everybody ain't you my nigga, everybody ain't me
If you real then I can see it, nigga
If you real then I can see it, nigga
Real niggas ain't gotta say they real
Real niggas ain't gotta say they real
Real niggas ain't gotta say they real

I ain't trippin' on no losses I can always get it back
Ain't trippin' on my exes I can always get 'em back
But that time was wasted I can never get it
And these niggas be the fakest I can never feel 'em
I had love and now it's hate for y'all that's official
I had nightmares of that picture
Or that court room being empty, way back at my final sentence
No letters or no pictures like a nigga just stopped livin'
But I just had to sit back and remember

Everybody ain't loyal, everybody ain't street
Everybody ain't you my nigga, everybody ain't me
If you real then I can see it, nigga
If you real then I can see it, nigga
Real niggas ain't gotta say they real
Real niggas ain't gotta say they real
Real niggas ain't gotta say they real

Rest in peace my family I can never get 'em back
I can never call my niggas that ain't get back on the nets
Rest in peace my nigga B, he in the clouds, nigga
I spend some time with your daughter, she got your smile, nigga
I had love and now it's hate for y'all that's official
Fuck Curry, I'ma rock with the Pistons
Fuck Peyton, I'ma rock with the Lions
You know I fuck with  every city in the Mitten
Met some real niggas in Kentucky
Bra took 35, no snitching
Lil' bro, if you with these niggas, sit back and remember

Everybody ain't loyal, everybody ain't street
Everybody ain't you my nigga, everybody ain't me
If you real then I can see it, nigga
If you real then I can see it, nigga
Real niggas ain't gotta say they real
Real niggas ain't gotta say they real
Real niggas ain't gotta say they real
I got some feelings that don't show no more
Me and some of my family, we ain't that close no more
I got some anger build inside me, I control it though
My morals out here runnin' wild, I couldn't control her bro
The first nigga from the family, take that college role
My mom and pop's couldn't even see it that's what hurt me most
Some niggas that I barely know they wanna see me make it
Some niggas I know all my life don't wanna see me blow
I had love and now it's hate for y'all that's official
I had nightmares of that picture
When we left that shootout, you still had bullets in your pistol
I don't fuck with y'all that's official
Nigga, that courtroom was empty way back at me final sentence
Got me like fuck niggas, 'cause

Everybody ain't loyal, everybody ain't street
Everybody ain't you my nigga, everybody ain't me
If you real then I can see it, nigga
If you real then I can see it, nigga

I could stack them hunnids to the roof
I ain't stopping 'til they stack to the moon
Nigga, without me, my family wouldn't have food
Anybody go against me gotta lose 

90’s baby but I get to that money like ’86 again
Lost pops and fell off, we back rich again
Gotta thank God for that prison bid
Music got us looking like the family's selling bricks again
Been on tour, been on TV, own businesses
Still I pull up with that stick and flip the whip you in 
You don't wanna hear bout indictments in the case I caught
Then, bitch, quit listening 
Free Mar Mar, he innocent
I was in the county indigent, now my pendant lit
Bitches love me, they go crazy 'bout that real nigga shit
Used to be a young follower, I was ignorant
If you don't want me to fuck her, go everywhere with that bitch, nigga
I'll drop a bird on your head
That chopper'll blow a third of the nerves out your head
Talking cash, shit, and we murdering that man
When they put them teddy bears on the curb for your ass, you lost

700K in here and my bag in this room

Got a record deal, my label don't like you when I hang out 
And let me know that they ain't know me 'fore I came out
Kevin Liles, I know it's a risk to have these chains out
But I'm that same nigga that'll knock a nigga brains out
Ex bitch ran off with the Rollie, hope she make it stretch

But I'm more mad at myself for tryna date a rat
Plus I make 30 for a show, so I'ma make it back
Used to order Wendy's fries, bring a shake with that
Now its Benihana rice, put some steak on that
The Mustang used to always run out of gas

I wanna see niggas win but everybody, you can't eat around
Some niggas, I wouldn't even go to sleep around
They had the bag, but ain't help me when they see me down
Same niggas DM'ing me tryna be around
Bitch, they see that Wraith and they think Meek around
Can't be around on choppers, yeah okay that's three around
Come get your friendly ass bitch before I beat her down
After I fuck, never again will she be around
It's crazy when your own people wanna bring you down
These niggas don't even know what they wanna beef about
He shot at me, and that's somethin' I can't sleep about
Drop his mama, leave the town, bitch, we even now 
How you gon' motivate the youth, rapping that gangster shit?
This what they like, so I'ma make the shit

So even if they didn't like it, I ain't changing shit, nigga

Alright, come on , alright 

Got a drop on this flexin' nigga, he from Tennessee
I had a thot, she be with the shit, she told me where he be
I said for sure, baby let me know if you wanna eat
She like, ""Von, you already know, just put your girl on fleek""
I'm like, ""Cool, I can do that, boo, what you want, some shoes?""
""Jimmy Choo? With a handbag, too? Red or baby blue?""
She get to smilin’, she ain't used to this 'cause she ain't used to shit
I'm just laughin', coulda been a pimp the way I move my lips
I be speedin', coulda been a driver the way I push the whip
You a ho, coulda been a bitch the way you throw a fit
But fuck that, right back to the script 'cause this a major lick
He got bricks, plus his neck is icy and it match his wrist
Now it’s like six, told her hit his phone, meet her in The Wic
But he ain’t go, but he ain't that slow, say meet ’em at the store
I'm like cool, let 'em front his move, do what he gon' do
’Cause this the plot, put 'em in the pot, let it cook like stew
I grab my Glock, it been through a lot, but it still shoot like new
We at the top, yeah we lost a lot​, but that just how it go
But check the score, if y'all lose one more, that's 6-24
Let me focus, can't be zoning out, he pullin' up now
He double parked, he ain't getting out, he in that push to start
That new Porsche, it's built like a horse, colors like the fourth
He got a ring, I guess he ain't divorced, wife probably a whore
Now she walk up, she struttin' her stuff, this bitch thick as fuck
Got in the truck, kissed him on his lip, he cuppin' her butt
Now I sneak up, crouching like a tiger, like Snoop off The Wire
Block on fire, so I take precaution, mask on, Michael Myers
I'm on his ass, he finna be mad, he gon' beat her ass
But this what happen, I got to the door, I thought I was cappin'
I was lacking, 'cause there go the opps, yellin' out, ""What's crackin'?""
I'm like, ""What?"" I'm like, ""Nigga who?"" I was born to shoot
I got aim, I'm like Johnny Dang when it comes​ to chains
So I rise, hit one in his arm, hit one in his thigh, this no lie
Bitch it's do or die, you said you gon' slide
You got some nerve, your shit on the curb, boy we put in work
From 64th, and from 65th, we not from 63rd

Bitch we not from 63rd
Bitch that's gang,

This bitch a ho, met her at the store, you know how it go
She wanna smoke, so I bought some dope and took her to the O

She walk out, she stop in her tracks, she get to steppin' back
Then I hear smack, this big goofy nigga, he pullin' her tracks
I wanna help, but this ain't my ho, you know how it go
Don't got no cape, I still got her phone, she takin' too long
She get loose, she run to my car, so I hit the locks
Tossed her her phone, told shorty I'm gone, bitch, you on your own
But here come goofy, he hollerin' and shit, yellin' 'bout a bitch
Picked up a brick, he merched it on Brick and threw it at my whip
Now I'm like, ""Shit,"" I hopped out so quick, then I raised my blick
And I don't miss, I let off two shots, I hit him in his shit
Now, Von, think quick, what you finna do? 'Cause this gon' make the news
Gotta make your move, told that bitch, ""Get in,"" 'cause she lookin' confused
I broke the rules, 'cause this bitch a witness, plus I just popped dude
But she ain't cryin', plus this ho was smilin' and this bitch looked cute
So we slide out, I'm checkin' my mirrors, made it to the house
Told her hop out, she say that she hungry, I nod back, ""No doubt""
""I know you mad 'cause I smoked your man, left him on the curb""
She started laughin', she say, ""Fuck that nigga, he from 63rd""

King Von,Crazy Story 2.0 by King Von (Ft. Lil Durk),"
Known to let that MAC fly just like my nigga Doe 
I'ma let this MAC fly with this, hold on
I said I'ma let that⁠—
Alright, come on , alright 

Got a drop on this flexin' nigga, he from Tennessee
I had a thot, she be with the shits, she told me where he be
I say for sure, baby let me know if you wanna eat
She like ""Von, you already know, just put put your girl on fleek""
I'm like ""Cool, I can do that, boo, what you want some shoes?
""Jimmy Choo, with a handbag too, red or baby blue?""
She get to smiling, she ain't used to this 'cause she ain't used to shit
I'm just laughing, could've been a pimp the way I move my lips
I be speeding, could've been a driver the way I push the whip
You a ho, could've been a bitch the way you throw a fit
But fuck that, right back to the script 'cause this a major lick
He got bricks, plus his neck is icy and it match his wrist
Now it's like six, told her hit his phone
Meet her in
The Wic
, but he ain't go
But he ain't that slow, said meet him at the store
I'm like cool, let him front his move, do what he gon' do
'Cause this the plot, put him in a pot, let it cook like stew
I grab my Glock, it been through a lot but it still shoot like new
We at the top, yeah we lost a lot, but that's just how it go
But check the score, if y'all lose one more, that's 6 to 24
Let me focus, can't be zoning out, he pulling up now
He double parked, he ain't getting out, he in that push to start
That new Porsche, it's built like a horse, colors like the fork
He got a ring, I guess he ain't divorced, wife probably a whore
Now she walk up, she struttin' her stuff, this bitch thick as fuck
Got in the truck, kissed him on his lip, he cuppin' her butt
Now I sneak up, crouching like a tiger, like Snoop off The Wire
The block on fire, so I take precaution, mask on, Michael Myers
I'm on his ass, he finna be mad, he gon' beat her ass
But this what happened:
I got to the door, I thought I was cappin'
I was lackin', 'cause there go the opps, yellin' out ""What's crackin?""
I'm like, ""What?"", I'm like, ""Nigga, who?"", I was born to shoot
I got aim,
I'm like Johnny Dang, when it comes to chains
So I ride, hit one in his arm, hit one in his thigh
This no lie, bitch it's do or die, you say you gon' slide?
You got some nerve, yo' shit on the curb, boy we put in work
From 64th, and from 65th, we not from 63rd

I got a drop on a rappin' nigga, I be from the 'Raq
I'm like, cool, better not front yo' move, or you become a pack
You see Von, you see 40 Glocks, see Booka, you see MAC
Yeah free Mak, gone for a double homi', foenem got yo back
But fuck that, say you smoking who? Quickest way to die
Snatch who chain? Off who neck? Not mine
Ain't no point in trying
They not out, plus the police hot, ain't no point in sliding
They be talking from the internet, they don't be outside
Hit the six, call DaDa out, tell him 'bout a lick
We need tape, we need rope and phones, don't forget the blicks
He like, ""Cool, how that nigga look?"" I pull up some flicks
He like, ""Damn I think I know the nigga"" He cool with his bitch
We at V-Live, but we went to Structure, but we played a lot
Got a goofy walking in and out, telling me his car
He in a Cat, bet
, I'ma pay you half, just finesse
I'm 300, clips don't come like that, three drums to his chest
Boom, boom, boom

See, I been gone
Was tryna hit a lick but that shit just went wrong
I got a thot
She right off the block, her crib be the spot
And we got Glocks
Tucked all in the shit, don't come unless you knock
But this bitch grimy
Told her 'bout this nigga, helped me set him up
And she was with it
She just want some shoes and she ain't give no fucks
So we do that
I was at his neck, creepin' from the back
But saw the opps and had to let 'em have it
How fucked up is that?
But where that bitch?
She ain't called me yet, we did that at six
And who got hit?
I know someone, check 'cause King Von, he don't miss
Now two weeks pass
I'm back on my grind, I can't waste no time
The opps been quiet
They be woofin', though, but them niggas not slidin'
And I been high
I can't even lie, that thot been on my mind
Why she ain't called?
I ain't seen her ass, I hope that she aight
Now it's midnight
I'm hittin' some blocks, just me and my Glock
Came to a stop
I'm at a red light, I usually don't stop
My phone keep ringing
Just a ho, of course, this bitch prolly bored
I press ignore
I ain't got no time, a whore gon' be a whore
Now I get that feelin'
Something ain't right, I look to my right
And I'm like, damn
There go that flexing nigga, he wavin' his pipe
He get to dumpin'
Bullets get to coming, my heart get to thumpin'
I feel something
My left shoulder hot, blood just get to gushing
I'm like shit, ain't this 'bout a bitch?
And he with that bitch
I got a glimpse
She got them big lips that's made for sucking dick
Now it makes sense
That ho set me up, that lil' dirty slut
The double cross
Tryna get me caught like I'm Randy Moss
Ah, shit
I just dropped my gun, plus I got one arm
I'm tryna drive
I can't shoot back now, this man on my ass
I almost crashed
But I got the wheel, he tryna kill for real
But there go twelve
He bust a quick right and I just bust a left

Aw, shit
What the fuck, gang, you good?
Damn, my shoulder
You know this bitch be fuckin' with me, gang
Damn, man, finish tellin' me about that shit that was crackin' off last week with them niggas and shit
Aw, yeah, aw, yeah, look
Now this what happened

A week later
My arm in a sling, I been
sippin' lean
Pure codeine
I don't feel a thing, my ho say I'm mean
I need a blunt
Stuff that bitch with Runtz, boy,
I'm on a hunt
And ain't no breakfast
But I'm a box a nigga, like some Cap'n Crunch
I got a tip
That that thot bitch be on 75th
Right off Cottage
With her best friend, gettin' her hair did
I'm like cool
Finna make my move, post up what I do
This bitch a fool for tryna play me out
Like this shit was cool
Now it's like two
Catch her walkin' out, her new hairstyle blue
And she look cute
But that mean shit to me, I crept up then I boomed
And that was that
Now I'm running back, I stop in my tracks
There go that Porsche
How crazy is that? Boy, I'm on his ass
The first blast
It shatter his glass, damn, this nigga fast
He hit the gas
I'm still shootin' at him, but I'm too far back
Damn, I'm hyped
Let me tuck this pipe, get up out of sight
'Cause I see lights
And them bitches bright, can't go to jail for life
So I take flight
Made it to the hood, everything went good
Knock on wood
Flame me up a 'Wood, Tooka smellin' good
Looked at my phone
Got a text from Herb, he say, ""What's the word?""
I say, ""Shit, I'm just coolin', bitch
I'm not from 63rd""

Huh?
DJ on the beat so it's a banger
Von

You know how I rock, I'm from that block, boy, I keep a Glock
One up top, pass it to my shorty, if the police hot
She a thot, she just suck me up, we up in your car
Crazy Story, that's her favorite song, she sing it bar for bar
Audemar, I ain't got one yet, I'll prolly go tomorrow
I'm a star, that's what mama told me, I was behind bars
When I stole that car, I ain't go that far, just around the block
I picked up Top, we was bad as hell, foenem throwin' rocks

Nuwap and Joey, they had on flip-flops
My luck, folks 'nem sellin' P's, they got the block locked
Popped up, unannounced, nigga, I'm gon' pop some
Stop frontin', doin' all that woofin' and ain't gon' drop none
Drop some, everybody holler, ""Von, drop somethin""
But I can't, 'cause all the opps dead, it's hard to drop somethin'
Smokin' on this Tooka pack and it's loud as fuck
Foenem caught Tooka ass gettin' off the bus
I know Tooka mad as hell, he probably tired of us
But when I die, find Tooka ass and I'ma beat 'em up
I kill shit, on some real shit, this the drill shit
And chill, bitch, this the Kel-Tec, I push your shit back
And sit back, this that Hellcat, this bitch go real fast
Ayy, who is that? He don't look familiar, foenem kill his ass
Aye, bill his ass
This that stinky pack, it came from Trinidad
Ain't come alone, hell nah, boy, I be with Smith & Wess'
Hit his chest, if that nigga run, fuck it, hit his back
Can't bring him back, now that nigga trendin' on the internet
You know how I move, I'm a fool, but I keep the tool
Stick and move
When you was up in school, I was on the news, breakin' the rules
Bullets hit his shirt, knock him out his shoes
Thought he was cool, but he got hit the worst
You know how I do
You know how I rock, I'm from that block, boy, I keep a Glock
One up top, pass it to my shorty, if the police hot
She a thot, she just suck me up, we up in your car

When I stole that car, I ain't go that far, just around the block
I picked up Top, we was bad as hell, foenem throwin' rocks

I ain't with the back and forth, no, I just can't get into that
Get his loin, get him whacked, if he ain't check, we spinnin' back
No, I don't know Will Smith but I know 'bout the Men In Black
I know how that block work, I come straight from dealin' crack
Dissin' in them lyrics think it's sweet, no he won't ride for long
Throwin' bullets, Pat' Mahomes, go check the scope, we got it on
Chiraq always ride with chrome, .40 shells gon' crack his dome
No need to stand over him, they know for a fact he gone
And I got this bitch on fire, told her ""Hide it or pass it on""
And your bitch can vouch, been with the gang, we don't cap in song
She want fame, she latchin' on, gon' blow me like a saxophone
Late night I might do one-sixty, swervin' through the traffic cone

You know how I rock, I'm from that block, boy, I keep a Glock
One up top, pass it to my shorty, if the police hot
She a thot, she just suck me up, we up in your car

Jammer get out that jam, I give him fifty, ain't gotta ask again
He was catchin' murders, way back then, that's when the MACs was in
I don't drink that red or that green, bring back the Act' again
Fucked her then she told me that she hate me, now she back again
And you still alive, you better be lucky, ain't no traffickin'
Hate they ass so much, we dig 'em up and tell 'em, ""Die again""
I can hit that club all by myself long as my strap is in

Niggas told me, all the rappers pussy, I ain't no rapper then
They told 'em what type of car I was in, I had to go get it wrapped again
Said when I get on, ain't no more thots, we fuckin' actresses
Bitch, you know, we lyin', we fuckin' thotties on the mattresses

Ayy, pop out like a ghost
They like, ""Prince Dre, boy, he back again"" 
If a body movin', I spin back again, clap again 
I be in the 'NOLA with a choppa like I'm Soulja Slim

O'Block, them my brothers, but 300 that's my woadie'nem
Them be my fuckin' partners 
I be movin' through this bitch, ain't worried 'bout no oppers 
I'm a fuckin' shotta 
And I'm dreaded like a Rasta

I been runnin' up that bag, I been trappin' out that Charger 
Foenem screamin', ""GetBack"" 
You know I'm with that 
Long live Baby Boy , T-Roy, can't forget Hec 
Project baby, six-four shawty, got it on my back 
Chopper bullet make 'em somersault, then put 'em on his back 

I ain't tryna squash no beef, nigga 
We into it 'til you die, real street nigga 
At yo' funeral, I might just slide, rest in pee, nigga 
Shoot up everybody that's outside
Bet Wooski feel this one 
I bet Wooski still twitchin' 
He changed, somethin' different
I got clips like Mel Gibson

All full, with none empty 
I know niggas scared to come around when I pop out outside 
I done gave niggas whole head starts , and still I hawked 'em down 
That shit crazy 
Krump was doin' all that woofin' and he ain't even make it

Melly got shot in the party, started Harlem shakin'

If the pigs keep tweakin', I'ma start fryin' bacon

The difference between me and you, is you be askin', I be takin'

Blast his ass
I don't even ask when it come to cash, they catch him
Blast his ass
Jammer get out that jam, I give him fifty, ain't gotta ask again
He was catchin' murders way back then, that's when the MACs was in
I don't drink that red or that green, bring back the Act' again
Fucked her then she told me that she hate me, now she back again
And you still alive, you better be lucky, ain't no traffickin'
Hate they ass so much, we dig 'em up and tell 'em ""Die again""
I can hit that club all by myself long as my strap is in"

Dumpin' the deal and I'm takin' a pack 
Now it's deeper than rap
Talk disrespect, so it's time to get back

Lil Gotti call thotty, that bitch is a smooch 
I'm so high, I think I'm with Woo
Lay down on that 'Tussin, I think I'ma snooze

We keep knockers like this shit essential
.22 long rifles, these bullets like pencils
Homicide, bodies drop when we bend through
Jackin' SK, bullets rippin' his dental
Paramedics, they droppin' it silly
Beam on his back, ain't no runnin' like Ricky 
Talkin' on bro, you gon' go out like Blizzy 
Scream DOA, and she poppin' her titty , poppin' her titty
Then back on that chain snatchin' 
And still ain't a thing happen

They keep speakin' on shit these niggas ain't do
Geek off the Xan', I go dumb with it too
He a fool with the deuce, he don't know what to do
Swear to god when I boom, better duck, better move 
Wait, I catch a O, yeah 
.40 gon' knock off his whole head 
But the other side, they never outside
So we said fuck it, we boom at the old heads
When I scream
DOA
it's a code red
And I put that on bro, we want all red
If they linkin' up, we smokin' all dead
I'ma say it again, we want all red 
That's on bro, when I up, better move 
With the deuce, I'ma fool, I go coo' 
.22 long rifle, shit long like a broom 
EBK bitch, we don't pick and choose
If I slide and he run wit 'em, he gettin' boomed 
I told AC, ""Bro watch what I do"" 
Spun through the 8, upped my fingers, they flew 
'Cause they know what I usually do, like 
30's or better when we spinnin' through 
If he up, ain't no tellin' me coo' 
And the way I went out for y'all, they wouldn't do 
That's on bro, I went dumb wit' a deuce
So don't question my loyalty, nigga, you fu' 
I ain't dissin', but this shit is true 
Ain't gon' speak on how many I threw 
They gon' act but they know what I do like 
They say, ""Kay you be buggin', just pass on"" 
First one I see, he get packed off 
Dougie B catchin' alley's off backboards
I threw ten, Dougie let off the last four 
Like, better run, 'cause I shoot with no sympathy 
DOA bitch, I'm dumpin' on anything 

Legs on my body, I feel like a centipede
We get muddy, I tell her don't Henny me
Wastin' my time on a bitch, are you kiddin' me? 
I ain't cuffin' her, like she'll milli' me
Niggas chattin', they diss on the internet

Sixty-two shots, I'ma knock off his fitted cap 
Be with them, show no remorse, bitch I'm flockin' that
Self-made, just tryna get paid

Forever ten toes, I'ma always be great

Break her phone if that bitch try to post us 
DTB telly, for sessions we poled up like 
And forever JB, we gon' go dumb

If he screamin' out Gz, I'ma throw 'em 
Bullets so big, hit his car, it might blow up 
On the 'Gram he be pickin' them poles up
Caught 'em in traffic and that nigga froze up 
Like, nigga talkin' fuck he wanna do? 
Oh, he chill with them opp niggas too? 
He better not be there when I come to 'oot 
Whatever they throw up, I'm droppin' it too
Fuck that, he get dropped wit' 'em too
When we bend through, we brung a thot with us to 
Do a drill, put the knock's in her boot 
All for bro, he get shot actin' cool 
They could suck a dick if they not feelin' me 
Call up Kay, he gon' slide with artillery 
Dougz in the back with a beam on the lemon-squeeze
Get caught outta bounds and I won't show no sympathy 
Lil' thottie, I love how she lickin' me 
But if she tryna line me, I'm lettin' this semi squeeze 
Niggas goofy, they hangin' with rats 
When you see me, don't give me a dap 
Free all the goons, I can't wait 'til they back 
Niggas better just stay where they at 
And you better not false an attack 
Brodie up pole, put your brains on your lap 
Off the muddy, ain't no lovey-dovey 
He move wocky, that boy catch a sluggie
Step in the party, these bitches they love me 
Off the muddy, my vision is blurry
I'm not worried, bro shoot in a hurry

Gunna keep talking and can't show a dollar 
Fuck that, catch him and mix him with grabba 
Fuck that, catch him and mix him with grabba 
Where he at? I’m tryna find him
Smooch' get the drop, I'ma get her to line 'em 
Throw up four, catch a shot to your knocker
Shorty be buggin', she want me to pop it
And that boy a bitch, nigga, stop it 
When you get shot for that shit you be droppin'
RPTK, know they don’t be on nothin' 
Catch a eight-o and throw eight at his muffin
Like, don’t diss 
They know who went out like Trip
That’s a headshot when Rah-Rah got hit 
How you still in the gang with no hit? 
Ain't did shit, like boy, I'm tellin' you, quit 
And Lil Cappa'll tweak with the stick  
That boy a demon, might run in your crib 

Grrah-grrah
Grrah-grrah, boom
Hey ladies, drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy girl, go Bananza
Shake ya' body like a belly dancer"

'Stand this
You're changing, I can't stand it
My heart can't take this damage
And the way I feel, can't stand it
Mmm, I don't understand this

How you love me? I'm up in the booth 
Said I'm lying, like, show me the proof 
Get in my bag, put a sixth in a deuce 
She like, ""Who Wockesha?"" Bitch, that's juice 
And you can't walk a mile in my shoes 
You ain't throw as much shots as I threw 
You don't tote on the Glock like I do
And you definitely don't bend that block like I do 
Lately, I've been feelin' alone 
But I'm clutchin' my chrome 
Pray to my mama I'm gon makе it home 
Twenty missеd calls, I ain't answer my phone 
Then I heard JB ain't make it home 
They say, ""Flocka, keep up and be strong"" 
Nah, why? 'Cause that shit was wrong 
And I told him to keep that bitch on 'em
I got my front, but is you behind me? 
Get goofy like Martin and Gina

Or get greedy like Keisha and Tommy 
Then get deady like Whitney and Bobby
I brought my pole if she think she gon' line me 
With the .30, I move extra cocky
If I ain't dead or in jail, they can't stop me 
Gotti and Notti and Scottie, my top three

Need a smooth G to spin, call up Gotti 
Sosa with knock's in ya lobby 
Know a 'ooter who aim for skullatis
He be buggin', his name is Lil Notti 
If I tell him to get 'em, I know that he got me 
So I got him, he stay right beside me 
I be thinkin' like, she movin' Wocky 
She keep tellin' me, ""Flocka, you got me"" 
Is you gon' climb for me if it get rocky? 
A parole shinin' through like it's hockey
Can't box right now, bullets punchin' like Ali 
Gotta keep it, I know they gon' watch me 
And I know that the feds tryna lock me 
Ridin' with it, I hope they don't stop me 
If they do, then it's gon' be a high-speed 
I pray God take the wheel, hope he got me 

I don't understand this
You're changing, I can't stand it
My heart can't take this damage
And the way I feel, can't stand it
Mmm, baby, I don't understand this

Uh
'Fore I focused on rap, I was sloppy
.40 Glocks used to pop where the opps be
Used to drop hollows, now I drop heat
If you speakin' on the 'Raq, I'm top three
I ain't talkin' videos, they watch me
He can't come to his hood, that's not me
I'm a one of one, lotta niggas took L's, I'm the one that won
Pull up, hunnid shooters and a hunnid guns
Big bro told me, ""Swerv', get shit straight""
Really made it off rap, he used to risk-take
I made two-three mill' off my mixtapes
All this ice, you would think a nigga wrist ache
I've been eatin' too good, havin' big steaks
Everybody used to hate, got the shit face
I'm like, ""Long live Nip', this a marathon""
But if it really was a race, you in sixth place
Pussy, Swervo gon' kill if you push me, uh
Gotta take drops, so I been sippin' Basa,
I used to smoke 'lato and zookie
And I got security wit' me, but lil' bro'll still pull up with a

And I'm still Humble Beast 'cause I'm from the streets but I'm quick to pull up on my bully

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together, at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
Even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier

Then only for a minute 
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me 
I wanna raise your spirits 
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Know that means I'll have to leave

Soldier's song, marching on, on
Hoping to see home
If I die before I
See your smile just one more time

Sometimes I question whether this shit matters
Puttin' substance into something in a world so used to instant gratification
I found this instrumental on my phone while on vacation
Ib sent it a year ago or so
I probably heard it before, but slept on it, you know?
Shit don't always connect as soon as you press play
At times you gotta step away, do some livin'
Let time provide a new prescription, givin' truer vision
I dibble-dabble in a few religions
My homie constantly telling me 'bout Quran, puttin' me on
I read a few pages and recognize the wisdom in it
But I ain't got the discipline for stickin' with it
Now I'm on the way to London, got a show for seven digits
I'm wonderin' just when did I become my biggest critic?
I wanna be my biggest fan, like how I was when didn't nobody know my jams
Today my son said, ""Dad, let go my hand""
Reminded me one day he's gonna be his own man
And my job is to make sure he's equipped
I gotta make sure he not no bitch 'cause niggas bound to try him
If I said I was the toughest growin' up, I would be lyin'
I had a fear of gettin' punched while everybody eyein'
Add to that a constant fear of dyin'
By gunshot wound, the other violent type of endings
I kept a tough demeanor on the surface but was mostly just pretendin'
Luckily my bluff was workin' way more often than not
But sometimes a nigga pulled my card, tryna expose me for a fraud
And with my reputation at stake
I was scufflin' just to save face
Couple wins, couple losses, some broken up too quick to call it
My last scrap was with Puff Daddy, who would've thought it?
I bought that nigga album in seventh grade and played it so much
You would've thought my favorite rapper was Puff
Back then I ain't know shit, now I know too much
Ignorance is bliss and innocence is just ignorance before it's introduced to currency and clips
Or bad licks that have a nigga servin' three to six, shit

Soldier's song, marching on, on
Hoping to see home
If I die before I
See your smile just one more time

Soldier's song
I could be one to lean on
Time will right the wrongs
Won't be long
How can we grow any closer?
How can we grow any closer?
How can we grow any closer?
How can we grow any closer?
Something inside of me's tryna crawl up to the surface
Something is suddenly smothering, stopping me
Stubbornly getting its way , way 
Drowning out the wave 
I've got a reason to believe that I'll turn out just fine
Soldier's song

Lord, please guide our steps
Watch us, cover us
So that every move we make is in alignment with Your will
Your purpose
Please fill us with Your spirit
Keep us forever in the present
For presence makes the strongest fathers
Teach us how to lead
Show us how to love"

Girl you party all the time
Don't let me stay on your mind
Adderall and cheap wine
Just to stay awake in conversation
We were always so damn insecure
So how could we ever know for sure
And disregard the way I know we feel
That would make this city way too real

If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me
We’re just strangers in passing casually
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me

The shirt on my back with the rips
Gems in my golden necklace
You didn't give me none of this
There's nothing for me to miss
We were too young on the day we met
How could we say we would not forget
And in the shadows there's a place for us
Somewhere hidden they can't find our love
Don't let 'em know

If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me
We’re just strangers in passing casually
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me

Eazy, and these days it's just you and me
This shit is dead and gone, it's not what it used to be
Someone give a eulogy
Know I'm hard headed and I might of acted foolishly
But you the one to hold us down usually
We was in a limbo
But of all people you ain't have to fuck with him though
That was my homie I had gave y'all the intro
Some things fall apart and some get thrown out the window
Remember when we first met we might've been too young
But we was from The Bay so we both was going too dumb
I used to be the one for you now you got a new one
So till the next lifetime, maybe we can do some'n
Eazy
If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me
We’re just strangers in passing casually
It’s not us no more It’s just you and me

On a crowded street
It's not us no more"

Girl, you share your truths with me
And I find them true, a muse, you in the booth with me

Can't spend no time on the nickle and dime'n
I got me a girl, she don't want no diamonds
A daily reminder to holla at God
Like ""Where did you find her? Good looking, my nigga""
Everything 'round me I took it
Did it with only the niggas I knew
And a few niggas I thought I knew better
There go my bitches, I always do better
But, you're more top echelon
My next probably be a step backwards
Niggas front when they get struck with love
Like the drama majors, be the best actors

Put an obstacle course up

They spinning my records so heavy, I'm topping the Forbes
Stuck in a rock and a hard place though

Watching through my fingers
Watching through my fingers

Shut my eyes and count to ten
It goes in one ear out the other, oh
One ear out the other, oh
Burning bright right 'til the end
Now you’ll be missing from the photographs
Missing from the photographs

Watching through my fingers
Watching through my fingers

In my thoughts you’re far away
And you are whistling a melody
Whistling a melody
Crystallizing clear as day
Oh I can picture you so easily
Picture you so easily

What’s gonna be left of the world if you’re not in it?
What’s gonna be left of the world? Oh

Every minute and every hour
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more
Every stumble and each misfire
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more

Watching through my fingers
Watching through my fingers

Caught off guard by your favourite song
Oh I’ll be dancing at a funeral
Dancing at a funeral
Sleeping in the clothes you love
It’s such a shame we had to see them burn
Shame we had to see them burn
What’s gonna be left of the world if you’re not in it?
What’s gonna be left of the world, oh

Every minute and every hour
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more
Every stumble and each misfire
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more

If you want to be a party animal, you have to learn to live in the jungle
Now stop worrying and go get dressed

You might have to excuse me
I’ve lost control of all my senses
And you might have to excuse me
I’ve lost control of all my words
So get drunk, call me a fool
Put me in my place, put me in my place
Pick me up, up off the floor
Put me in my place, put me in my place

Every minute and every hour
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more
Every stumble and each misfire
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more
Watching through my fingers
Watching through my fingers

Cause every minute and every hour
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more"

Do you still believe in love?
Or do you like drugs?

Ran into a night owl rollin' White Owls
Girl it's been awhile since I hit a White Owl
I'm with it though, she a centerfold
Big ol' blunt look like tentacles
She strip in Europe, Interpol
Don't remember her in her clothes
I fucked her friend, damn they was close
Let's reunite, let's get em close
Hit 'em twice in a row, hit a flight, and I'm ghost
That's the last time I seen her though
She be gettin' too eager, ho
Stamp it like it's my visa
Cheefin' off of these berries
When the world gets heavy and it hurts to carry
I'm her Midnight Mercenary, Fiend

It's lit, feel the buzz?
That's a half? Shit it was
It's lit, feel the buzz?
It's lit, feel the buzz?

She take me to a place that I never would discover
Might never have another, so I had to fuck her
Reach into my pockets, damn I ain't got a rubber
See my nigga Ron like L. Ron Hubbard, he be outta space
Say he got a case of straps at the back of the hotel cupboard
Room 508, check by the safe, she say ""Boy you got it made
Do you got a cape?"", I ain't with the games ma, do I gotta wait?
I'm quite impatient, intoxication got me feelin' like procreating
Girl I'm the baker, you surely caking
Stand back, catch my amazing graces
Photo finish and fornication
Photo finish and fornication, fiend

It's lit, feel the buzz?
That's a half? Shit it was
It's lit, feel the buzz?
It's lit, feel the buzz?
Feel the buzz
Can you feel the buzz?
Feel the buzz, ohh-whoa, yeah
Do you believe in love?
What's your drug? What's your drug?
Ohh-whoa

Take it all the way from the beginning
Yea, yea, yea
Now comes the question of which intro do you use?
Do you use this intro or the other intro I was talkin' on?
But, then that lets people know I had more than one take
So maybe we should just not use this and use the other intro
So people would think I just took it straight through
Yea, let's do that...

You'd be surprised how many truths you can hide in flows
I'm listenin' to this beat with my eyelids closed
Thoughts keep flashin' and I keep laughin
I never thought that I would fuck Irish hoes
Maybe Asian bitches or Caucasian bitches
Remember when I got to New York I was lost
Because all I ever saw was Jamaican bitches
I ain't barely know what Jamrock was
Lil' country nigga God damn I was
To you niggas talkin online until you make it this high
Then you could never understand this buzz, well
Maybe if you put yourself in the shoes
Of a nigga comin' straight out the South
No gold grill just a east coast feel
And a set of crooked teeth in his mouth
Make them hoes bounce, that can't get enough
Niggas say I made it I ain't make it enough
Man hang that nigga, you a real lame ass nigga
If you ain't got my tape in your truck
Cole, um world don't you forget that
I think I lost my mind round the same time I lost my six pack
But no sit-ups for me
, long as my dick still get up for me
Long as a ho still give up for me
She usually charge but she get us for free
Woah, that's TMI, lil' something like TMZ
Scared of the days you'll be seeing me
Cause my girl do not play, coach DNP
That's something for the hoop fans
Just copped her the coupe man
No drop top but a slot on the roof that can slide out
And get a little sun while you ride out
Ced on the beat let me vibe out
We was 15 with a ASR up in my house
Writin' rhymes out, momma made it happen
Could've been a lawyer but I made it rappin'
He made it rappin', now at the shows he the main attraction
Another shot of Henny so I'm faded askin'
How long do this drug called fame be lastin'?

Another shot of Henny so I'm faded askin'
How long do this drug called fame be lastin'?

Yo, thinkin' out loud
I must have about a milli on me right now
And I ain't talkin' about that Lil Wayne record
I'm still the highest sellin' female rapper, for the record
Man, this a 65 million single sold
I ain't gotta compete with a single soul
I'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll
Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul
Pretty women, wassup? Is you here right now?
You a stand-up or is you in your chair right now?
Uhh, do you hear me? I can't let a wack nigga get near me
I might kiss the baddest bitch if you dare me
I ain't never need a man to take care of me
Yo, I'm in that big boy, bitches can't rent this
I floss everyday, but I ain't a dentist
Your whole style and approach, I invented

LOL to the bank, check in my account
Bank teller flirtin' after checkin' my account
Pretty ladies, are you here? Truffle butter on your pussy
Cuddle buddies on the low, you ain't gotta tell your friend
That I eat it in the morning, cause she gon' say ""I know""
Can I hit it in the bathroom? Put your hands on the toilet
I'll put one leg on the tub, girl, this my new dance move
I just don't know what to call it
But, bitch, you dancing with the stars
I ain't nothin' like your last dude
What's his name? — Not important
I brought some cocaine if you snortin'
She became a vacuum, put it on my dick like carpet
Suck the white off, white chocolate
I'm so heartless, thoughtless, lawless, and flawless
Smallest, regardless, largest in charge
And born in New Orleans, get killed for Jordans
Skateboard, I'm gnarly, Drake, Tunechi, and Barbie
You know!

Yeat,The Second Coming by William Butler Yeats,"Turning and turning in the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Things fall apart
;
the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy
is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity.
Surely
some
revelation
is at hand;
Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out
When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
Troubles my sight:
somewhere in sands of the desert
A shape with lion body and the head of a man
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
Is moving its slow thighs,
while all about it
Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.
The darkness drops again, but now I know
That twenty centuries of stony sleep
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?"

Chopped cheese, knot knees

Call it up, chalk it up
Move over
I make sacrifices, bloody sacrifices
Cutthroat,
rabbit's toe

See a nigga in all red from the North with the pole
It ain't Santa Claus
Brought my gifts to Atlanta, I'm Atlanta Claus
I can smell you pussy with the panties off, I
Been gettin' to the bread, tryna keep this shit low
But it ain't workin', my
Circle on fire like a circus now
Around the same niggas I been around, so
Of course, I , endorse my 
Ratchet ass nigga from the North Side 
It's astigmatism, you got poor sight 
Let the bitches forget it, I do it Alzheim'
Of course I , gotta voice my 
Opinion on that ass when you walk past

Niggas pull strings like a guitar, guitar
G-Star jeans on my sneakers
I'm a real soulful nigga, collard greens inside your speakers 
Ferguson days on Castro, wasn't no cash flow
But I'm good for the arch, I'm Dr. Scholl's
I'm good for your heart, let me snatch your soul, soul, soul
Bloody sacrifices

Yeah, ayy
Look at what a motherfucker do for the cash intake
They'll be right across your head like it's Ash Wednesday
You got to just get off your ass like your ass is fake
You can't sit, and if we ain't siblings, then I can't relate
To they shit, I'm Asic, I run shit, I got it jumpin' like pump fake
I don't need nothing but one take
I'm from the part of the city where young nigga keep him a nine like one plus eight
Our politician a fuckface
Corrupt like a Dogg Pound Gangsta
We duel like a small town wager
How I'm the dropout major
Success stories, I favor
Used to cover my scars, out here tryna cover The Fader
Yeah, Pro Tools, knobs, and the faders
Tell pigs as-salamu alaykum
You ain't 'bout static like AM radio, ain't even play him
I put my heart and my all in my art, I'm alternate
All of them are the same, it's harder to tell 'em apart some days
I thought I'd call 'em out altogether
Rather than waste the amount of bars it'll take for me to call 'em out by name
Caught a glimpse of the alternate world I've introduced to you
Via the studio, got 'em studying our mixtapes
I'm from the hood like my mama, put that on my mama
I lay the law down like parliament, all just with a pen and page

I make sacrifices, bloody sacrifices

You can't be everything to everybody
I wanna be your lover, your best friend
Your Batman, Spider-Man
Fighter pilot shooting down your rivals and
I wanna damn near kill you to be the one that heal you up
I wanna be the one that feel you up
On nights when you need good dick to cheer you up
I wanna be the one to build you up
A wall worth five billion bucks to keep out the rah-rah
And the blah-blah-blah so nobody try to steal your thunder
Pull you under
Toss my hopes out, Royal Rumble
We done moved out to the boondocks
Built a big house, there he wonders
How somewhere along the way
He went from Huey to Eddie Wuncler
I been so disconnected, my perspective is ignorant
When you rich, niggas don't wanna correct you
Say something crazy, they won't interject
Do every drug that you want, they gon' let you
Dangerous when it's nobody to check you
I be havin' to check myself
Nigga, stop holding that money, you know you got plenty
I be havin' to spread my wealth
I used to be at the crib myself
7 years old, off of Bragg Boulevard
Where they bag up the raw
They gon' stand on the corner, one hand on they balls
And they ran when the cops come, there go the laws
Then I packed up a bag and I trapped it up north on the path of a star
And I ran into you like I met you before
Now damn, me and you goin' half on a boy, sing

Huggin' the block, huggin' the block all day
I had nowhere to go, she gave me a place to stay
She gave me her heart to hold, I still got that shit to this day
She ridin' with me on the road, she ridin' with me in the A
Huggin' the block, huggin' the block, okay
She gave me the gift of my son, and plus we got one on the way
She gave me a family to love, for that, I can never repay
I'm crying while writing these words, the tears, they feel good on my face, hey

And yesterday could feel just like a waste, yeah
If I don't love you how I'm supposed to
And yesterday could feel just like a waste, yeah
If I don't love you how I'm supposed to

Dreamville,Heavens EP by Dreamville & J. Cole,"

Yeah, yeah 
 Yeah  
Know what I mean?

Freedom, know what I mean? 
Uh  
Yeah
Yeah 
Yeah 
Yeah

With every record, I be asking the masses to tune your hearts to me
I represent intelligent niggas that grew up harshly
But lately I've been questioning, second guessing, whether or not I've got something to offer since I done eluded poverty
Or has the money watered me down, that truth is hard for me
Like the second time I got cut from the junior varsity
Fightin' back tears, I promised to switch gears
And said to myself ""Whatever you do, you won't do it partially""
From this day forward, I move with a new ferocity
Ferrari coupe velocity, a fail-proof philosophy
Success is in the effort, so if a nigga tried his hardest
I'm at peace knowing God ain't deal it in this group of cards for me
Some people say that I'm running third, they threw the bronze at me
Behind Drake and Dot, yeah, them niggas is superstars to me
Maybe deep down, I'm afraid of my luminosity
So when you see me on red carpets, I'm movin' awkwardly
Posin' all nervous, afraid of the judgement
And the thought of showin' too much of my day is repugnant
I be keepin' my kids away from the gaze of the public
'Cause these days, it feel like hate is they favorite subject
Fuck it, attitude like a young O'Shea with a AK
Aimed at your brain, violate, and I bust it
I don't play when it come to family, that's one thing I refuse
Pimpin' they kids out for views or just to be in the news
Could never be me, I piss in the celebrity tea
God with me on this record, this is Heaven's EP
The tale's official, the best nigga breathing, it just failed to hit you
You couldn't tell 'cause you fell for the bells and whistles
And that's an area I don't excel
I'm from the 'Ville where young girls talk grown as hell
That's raw, never saw one person go to Yale
But every nigga that I know done gone to jail
At least once, provin' we the ones police hunt
For the pains, we smoke three blunts the size of tree trunks
Too much hunger, it's no wonder these niggas can't keep up
So saying ""Yes"" to a feature just means I'm 'bout to eat lunch, bitch
I'm goin' for it, no never shall he punt
I'm the one and you can be sure, speaking of beachfront
I'm kickin' my feet up while I write this in somewhere tropical
Supposed to be relaxin', this passion makes that impossible, mm


Supposed to be relaxin', this passion makes that impossible

And pick up Stevie Wonder to be the wide receiver? 
Green paper, gold teeth, and pregnant golden retrievers
All I want, fuck money, diamonds, and bitches, don't need 'em
But where the fat ones at? I got somethin' to feed 'em
It's some cooking books, the black kids never wanted to read 'em

 Fuck the fame and all the hype, G

Golden rubbers in these denim pockets

On my waist, there's a black Glock 
New girl moved on the block 
She been plottin' on my brown
cock

Last night I slept over hers 
During sex, I overheard 
A sword sliced the air, I pulled out the na-na
Rolled off the bed, then shot back, pow-pow
Blood on the sheets, probably spillin' from my gash
Looked out the glass, seen him sprintin' on the grass
A real ninja, with the blade and the mask
Had them gold ninja stars, and red Supreme nunchuks
Now she tryna patch me up, but
Girl, I was just tryna get a
nut bust
If that's your ex, you should probably own a pistol
But I'm guessin' it's wiser to exit with dude

The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Naked body, fresh out the shower
And you touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in bed
But check your window

He's at your window

Night light hits off, turnin' kisses to bites
I'm a down to Earth nigga with intentions that's right
You'll be down in Earth quicker if you diss me tonight
But I'll be the happiest if you decide to kick it tonight
We can chill and I can act like I don't wanna fuck
You can tell me all your problems like I really give one 
But I give two for us 'cause you're the one that I want
Don't wanna seem like a punk pussy that simps over punk pussy
See when I'm with my friends I just put on a front
But in the back of my top, I'm writing songs about we
We, as including I, and yourself, making three
Little ones,
the drums are hitting pretty hard if you ask me
You're a pretty broad in the top three
Of things that I've been waiting to come, so
Meet me by the lake around 10 and skinny dippin' and then
We can begin the pretend game, I wanna be Finn from Adventure Time
The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Naked body, fresh out the shower
And you touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in bed
But check your window
He's at your window

One, two; you're the girl that I want
Three, four, five, six, seven; shit
Eight is the bullets if you say no after all this
And I just couldn't take it, you're so motherfuckin' gorgeous
Gorgeous, baby you're gorgeous
I just wanna drag your lifeless body to the forest
And fornicate with it
But that's because I'm in love with you, cunt

I just wanna talk, and conversate
'Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate
And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date
So just say yes, let the future fall into place

New magic, new magic, new magic wand
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone 
New magic , new magic, new magic wand

Don't call me selfish, I hate sharin'

You roll the dice, hit a seven, sure you right
Beginner's luck, you not my first, who gives a fuck?
Your other one evaporate, we celebrate
You under oath, now pick a side and if you don't

I'll pick you both

It's not a joke, murder she wrote

Ayo, take one look in the mirror, implications so clear
I live life with no fear, except for the idea
That one day you won't be here
I will not fetch the ball
Eyes are green, I eat my vegetables
It has nothin' to do with that broad
But if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well
I got a plan, 'bout to walk in the pen
If you can't understand, I'm a hawk in the gym
Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest
That I need to get off, or I ain't talkin' to them
Can't be in the picture if it got no frame
Gon' let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame
Blow the whole spot up, 'cause I ain't–
I wanna share last names, I wanna be your number one
Not the other one, keep it on the low
I'm in my right mind, keep it on a high
Janis Joplin spillin' feelings, now I'm out here moppin' 'em
Four on the floor, pack up your bags, we hit the store
Grab our supplies, no need for masks, bust through the door
Get the job done like retirement, I admit you look concerned

Crashed the McLaren, bought me a Tesla
I know you sick of me talkin' 'bout cars 
But what the fuck else do you want from me?
That is the only thing keepin' me company
Purchase some things until I'm annoyed
These items is fillin' the void 
Been fillin' it for so long
I don't even know if it's shit I enjoy 
Current battle as an adult
My partner is a shadow
I need love, do you got some I could borrow?
Fuck it, I could find some tomorrow
But that never comes 
Like a vasectomy, what have I done? 
I got the talent, the face and the funds
Found myself long ago but I haven't found someone 
Mirror, mirror on the wall 
The loneliest of them all 
Cupid actin' stupid
Do you got another number I could call?
Never had a pet
I never had a pet
There's more fish in the sea
But I never had a goldfish to begin with
I never had a dog
So I've never been good with bitches
'Cause I never threw a ball, fetch
I never had a pet, that's where it stems from, I bet

Golf Wang, Golf Wang, no, fuck you, na, na, na, na, na, na!
Why y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on
A can of beans, bitch, I'm on
Your boy is bad to the bone

How many fags can a lightbulb screw?
Well if it has a dick, maybe two or six
And tell the NRA I'm about to lose my shit
And shoot through Wayne LaPierre's hair with a crucifix
How many ladies in the house?
How many ladies in the house without a rich nigga, huh?
A little Jergens in my palm for the jerkin'
Hope my mom don't catch me, tryna set mood
Little Redtube, fuck lotion, I don't need lube, dry fist suits me

Up and down, friction make a *fap fap* sound
The shit's kind of disgusting
Fap time and before I flatline
Clancy chimes in my room and catch me
This shit's so damn embarrassing, like—
Oh, shit, aw, fuck
What the fuck?
Aw, I'm sorry
Is that my shirt?
Yeah, I'm sorry, I wanted some bangs
Clean that shit up, we're going to the office!
Fuck"
"Tyler, The Creator","Bastard by Tyler, The Creator","
Yo, yo, fuck 2DopeBoyz and fuck Nah Right
And any other fuck-nigga-ass blog that can't put an 18 year old nigga
Making his own fucking beats, covers, videos and all that shit
Fuck you post-Drake-ass cliche-jerking, LA-Slauson rapping
Fuck-nigga-ass Hypebeast niggas, now back to the album

Well, Tyler, hi, I'm Dr. TC and um, I'm guessing
that your teacher sent you here to talk 'cause you were misbehaving
Um, it's gonna be three sessions: today, tomorrow, and the next day
So, just tell me something about yourself...
Well, look, if, if you don't talk, I mean, these sessions are going to go slower, so-

This is what the devil plays before he goes to sleep
Some food for thought? This food for death, go 'head and fucking eat
My father's dead, well, I don't know, we'll never fucking meet
I cut my wrist and play piano 'cause I'm so depressed
Somebody call the pastor, this bastard is so possessed
This meeting just begun, nigga, I'm Satan's son

My mother raised me, a single parent, so it's apparent
That I got love for my mother, none of you other fuckers
Are much important, I'm getting angrier while recording
I'm feeling like the bulls, I've got a gang of wolves
Odd Future is children that's fucked up in they mental
Simple, but probably not, fuck em

I'm tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck
Drunk white girls: the only way I'll get my dick sucked
Suspended from school, coolest nigga without effort
Easy to spot, like black bitches with fake leopard
Soak me up in a tampon, but keep the lamp on
'Cause this album pack enough evil
That you can't fit inside a Jansport
Go to school with this

I go from AP to JC inside a fucking week
Waking up with random girls like ""Yo, bitch, how the fuck we meet?""
I stay with grandma, she always bitching about her carpet
Every time I walk inside the house, she always tend to start shit
No to drugs, I never spark it,
I used to be bullied for honor classes
By those that were slow as molasses
Take this shit to school
Raquel treat me like my father, like a fucking stranger
She still don't know I made ""Sarah"" to strangle her
Not put her in danger and chop her up in the back of a Wrangler
All because she said no to homecoming,
demons running
Inside my heads telling me evil thoughts
I'm the dream catcher but nothing but nightmares are caught,
go to sleep

I wear green hats because I'm fortunately lucky
""Fuck me,"" the monster said, somehow the monster's dead
Inside of me, but the thoughts it tells me are still evil
With this state of mind, big moves, Max Keeble
I'm on my grind feeble,
my music is either
A fucking sin or too illegal, play this shit in church

I graduated without honors or fucking father
He died  No bitch, don't even fucking bother
I wanted a brother, my mother I told her
But instead I got a sister, just like me with her mister nada
So both of our imaginations are creations of the fucking situation
That's having our brains racing like Dayton
Wearing some fucking Heelys

I know you fucking feel me, I want to fucking kill me
But times I'm so serious, you think I'm silly
I'm doing Big Style Willy couldn't touch 11
Seven, what's religion nigga? I am legend
I roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition
I created O.F. cause I feel we're more talented
Than 40 year old rappers talking about Gucci
When they have kids they haven't seen in years
Impressing their peers
With the same problem, the only way to solve them
Is to go to Father's Day convention with a gold revolver
Life's a salad, I'm a toss it, eat that shit up, Rick Ross it
Shit it out, bag it up, sell it, I'm so damn rebellious
Cause my mother let me do what I want
She wasn't careless, protective she is the bear
The shit is so bare, my diary isn't hid
My father didn't give a fuck, so it's something I inherit
My mom is all I have so it's never meet the parents
When Danielle or Milan decide to fucking share
This confused boy, I wanna hug, oy
I’m bad for your kids to listen to
, s
oy is not the choice
I'm bad milk, drink it
Whoa, umm, it seems you had a lot to say
Uh, who knows I might feel as I'm evaluating

My wrist is all red from the cutter
Dripping cold blood like the winter,
the summer
Is never that's equivalent to me and Sarah
Well that's not her fucking name, but I think this shit is clever
My niggas wanna know if I'm fucking, if I'm kissing
But I'm sitting here downing beers simply just wishing
With a tear they try to tell me but I never listen
'Cause I don't give a shit like sitting down pissing
Eighteen, still talking to imaginaries
Hopefully they see the talent I carry just like Jimmy
Losers can never win me, you can never offend me
My goal in life is a Grammy, hopefully mom'll attend the
Ceremony with all my homies,
I'm suicidal
This my Zombie Circus
, I hope the majors heard this
Fuck a deal, I just want my father's email
So I can tell him how much I fucking hate him in detail

Wow, umm
So, Tyler, if you had the chance to tell him something
What would you tell him?"
