It's too late 'cause I'm here to stay and these girls know that I'm nasty (Mmm)
I sent her back to her boyfriend with my handprint on her ass cheek
City talkin', we takin' notes
Tell 'em all to keep makin' posts
Wish he could, but he can't get close
OG so proud of me that he chokin' up while he makin' toasts
I'm the type that you can't control, said I would, then I made it so
I don't clear up rumors (Ayy), where's y'all sense of humor? (Ayy)
I'm done makin' jokes 'cause they got old like baby boomers
Turned my haters to consumers, I make vets feel like they juniors (Juniors)
Say your time is comin' soon, but just like Oklahoma (Mmm)
Mine is comin' sooner (Mmm), I'm just a late bloomer (Mmm)
I didn't peak in high school, I'm still out here gettin' cuter (Woo)
All these social networks and computers
Got these pussies walkin' 'round like they ain't losers

I told you long ago on the road
I got what they waiting for (I got what they waiting for)
I don't run from nothing, dog

You was never really rooting for me anyway

Back with the remix
These boys all my sons like Phoenix
(Pooh, you a fool for this one)
My city and state never ever seen this
Jimmy Neutron, I'm a young boy genius
(
Oh Lord, jetson made another one
)
On the futon, I'ma give her that penis
When this shit's done, I'ma fill up arenas
Ooh, like Gilbert Arenas
Shoot my shot, I'm still with the demons, ooh
I keep it thorough
I got five chicks in New York, that means one in each borough
I'm in the pocket like Burrow
When I'm back home, though, they treat me like Robert De Niro
Took her to Taco Bell, bought her a churro
Took her home, gave her a cinnamon swirl
I left it in, now I got a one-year-old
Zeros on zeros on zeros (Zeros)
That's what my bank account balance say (Woo)
I got a check from the shoe company
Now I do anything that New Balance say
I bought her a plane ticket, out of state
I got me a shorty from 'round the way
Said, ""I'm in town today""
She said she comin' over and she down to stay
I got a hit, she been playin' that shit
So when she pull up on me, I know what she 'bout to say
[Chorus: Jack Harlow & DaBaby]
What's poppin'?

Call me DaBaby, no toddler (Wah)
I'm real creative and stylish, FN in my denim
I send a hit, make him spin 'em
And I just flew back from L.A. on the jet yesterday (Nyoom)
I go back and forth like I play tennis
I fuck with your ho, yeah, I'm fit for it
Still on the Billboard, the number one song in UK
And I done got so fuckin' rich, all these hoes on my dick

She eat it like a Pac-Man, nigga (Eat it)
Whoop a nigga like I'm Batman, nigga

The reason I ain't fuckin' with these rap-ass niggas
'Cause they cap-ass niggas (Cap), and they raps ain't real (Cap)
Believe me, you wanna keep your life, then take it easy
I'm rockin' water diamonds, need a Squeegee
These niggas watered down, they drinkin' Fiji
My whip is orange and brown like I'm in Cleveland
My bitch is Mello Yello like a soda (Soda)
These niggas tattletalers, I'm a soldier

Hop out that Scat and I caught her
I'm out here with somebody daughter
She callin' me daddy, I'm somebody father
I gotta go gets it, I will not go kiss it
Or put my lips on it like somebody water
The diamond, the glacier, the card in the wallet
She pulled up to fuck me but nobody caught her
She told me that she wasn't feelin' my music
I fucked her, she told me, ""It's nobody harder""
And I'm with the G-ski, I need that shit for the freeski
We are not buyin' no pussy you sellin' on Peachtree
It's so much work on my celly
I had to go tell all my bitches, ""Email it to reach me""
All in my DM, I'll follow your BM
She play with the croski, we used to fuck on the lowski
She use to lie on my bed and go lie to your face
And say I'm just a broski, nigga, you knows me
You ain't believe it, you wanted to toast me
I had extendi as long as a ruler
In case you was coolin' and wanna approach me
Dropped the Bentayga, came back in the Cullinan
She wanna fuck again, I want that tongue again
Stuck it so deep that she cough up her lung again
Five-star bitches, they on the run again, run again
Runnin' in diamonds, they illuminatin' the way that I come again
I just put so many pennies on the watch
That I don't ever got to stunt again, nigga, lil' Tory[Chorus: Jack Harlow, Tory Lanez &

Even some homies be wearing expressions
I be discouraged from sharing my blessings (Damn)
We used to share a connection
Now it just feels like it's wearing and stretching
I'm getting real sick of taking advice
From people that never could stare at reflections (Ooh)
Somewhere in there is a lesson
Y'all ain't evolvin', it's very depressing
I'm at the club with the basketball team
Me and the Cardinals are sharing a section (Facts)
Gotta cherish the present
I'm drinking water and wearing protection
Got a career and I'm very invested
Some people call it a scary obsession (Ooh, period, but)
I like to call it a passion
I can't be sitting relaxin' (Nah, I can't)
PG, we getting some traction
I'm at the venue, it's packed in (Packed out)
I'm digging her accent
I got a B.B. Simon belt on me
And she tryna get it unfastened
That's my type of distraction
That's my type and she Latin (That's facts, ooh)
Got my own flow and I'm 'bout to get a patent

Yeah
[Chorus]
The ones that hate me the most look just like me
You tell me what that means
Make a slick comment and see what that brings
I seen it go down, we can reenact things
Extreme like BMXing
These boys pussy and they PMSing
People in the city see the movement occurring
And say, ""My God, I wanna be in that scene""
Damn right, you wanna be in this scene
She at the video tryna be in this scene
Used to fantasize 'bout bein' this seen (Seen)
Bluegrass girl, but she got big dreams
Can't touch me, I got instincts
Locked in the house, but I'm plottin' things
I brought a gang to the party with me
Five white boys, but they not NSYNC (Yeah, woo)
[Verse]
Fuck what y'all think
Fuck everything that you say about me
My dawgs like to play Madden and 2K
But one thing they don't do is play about me
My homeboy Tyler, he play in South Beach
He told me this summer he gon' fix my jumper
I told Boi-1da that we might got a thumper
I been tryna pop, now I'm on like Shumpert (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now they on my bumper
Green room chock-full of all my comforts
Hotel room like heaven on earth
Got angels in my bed with some all-white covers
Ace Pro, Nemo, Lucci and Quiiso, Shloob, Clay, 2for
And I got a few more I call my brothers
I got a lot of flows and they all like butter, ooh (Ah)
You know what that means
I came home nice, but I'm goin' back mean
I'm 'bout to globe-trot when they know a vaccine
Mothafuckers act lost, but they know exactly what's goin' on
Made a mil' and I don't know what to blow it on
I tell the critics, ""Shut up,"" like my show is on
Gave a T-shirt to her, said, ""Throw it on""
She one of many high school classmates I'm growin' on (Growin' on, growin' on)
My peers ain't poppin', they don't know what's goin' wrong
Y'all well dressed, but you ain't got soul and you just can't sew it on
I'm tryna tell y'all boys, I got a few songs I could sell y'all boys
I tried it back then, it was, ""Hell nah, boy"" (Nah)
Now I'm in a box like a Kellogg's toy (Like a, like a, ooh)[Chorus]
The ones that hate me the most look just like me (Like me)
You tell me what that means

Now count it, five, ten, yeah, fifteen, twenty
Twenty-five, thirty, yeah, get the money
Throw it in the furnace, yeah, this shit be funny
Earn it just to burn it, swag drip—
[Verse 1: Jack Harlow]
I used to rock a toboggan
Headphones around my neck, tryna be like Shady
Now the phone that's in my pocket seem to keep vibratin'
I got all these Ronnie Bennetts tryna be my baby
Tryna fiancé me
I take the steering wheel and drive them girls beyond crazy (Crazy)
I'm on a song with my idol
I'm a cold-blooded version of the song title
I put these diamonds in the ring like they was Shawn Michaels
I can't put the Louis V inside the wash cycle
I take this shit to the cleaners
'Bout to cop me a Bimmer, I got a special demeanor
She was mine when I seen her, I'm gettin' meaner and meaner
Called the front desk and asked for a steamer
I'm a bitch bagger, not a Twitch streamer
I'm eatin' pizza in Little Italy, damn, I used to hit Caesars
She 'bout to finish, but wait a minute, it gets deeper
Same kid just a bit sleeker
[Chorus: Eminem & Cordae]
Yeah, now count it, five, ten, yeah, fifteen, twenty
Twenty-five, thirty, yeah, get the money
Throw it in the furnace, yeah, this shit be funny
Earn it just to burn it (Listen, uh)
[Verse 2: Cordae]
They say my killing's horrendous, ""How he still in the business?""
Rich as hell and it's feelin' tremendous
Ma dukes chillin' in Venice, compliments of her eldest descendant
Give hell with these writtens, this shit only propel my ascension
I held my position in any situation that's needed
This year I'm shittin' on niggas for the way we was treated
I see the impact of all my creations increasin'
My step in time with these Pantheons, it all was divine
I'm in this moment of my life where shit is fallin' in line
And lookin' back, I swear to god, you'd think it all was designed
A true movie script, I can't really ever fuck no groupie bitch
All she got is diamonds on her mind on some Uzi shit
A whole generation of geniuses I'm influencin'
I only hang with real niggas who I'm congruent with
I manifest nothing less than the best outcome
Just watch my moves with this next album, nigga

Now count it, five, ten, yeah, fifteen, twenty
Twenty-five, thirty, yeah, get the money
Throw it in the furnace, yeah, this shit be funny
Earn it just to burn it, swag drippin' from me[Verse 3: Eminem]
My sentences are harsh, every single's bar's like a verdict
I say it with conviction, but this time you're not gonna serve it
But as soon as I read it, you know that you're about to get murdered
When I cap, it'll punish, then put you in a box like a juror (Haha)
If there's a rapper I haven't ate (Where?)
We ain't battled, either that or they won't collaborate
'Cause pad or paper freestyle will settle that debate (Yup)
I call it guillotine style 'cause even off the head, I decapitate
Yeah, bitch, I go harder than Carter III (What?)
But I think your thottie just thought of me
She got a body and bottom like Cardi B
And she be stalking me like I was broccoli
I'm getting brain now like a lobotomy
You probably thinkin' you had that shit in the bag like it's colostomy (What?)
It's a red alert, you better skrrt or try to get on my level first
Bitch, I'd had to shovel dirt and dig a hole to get on yours
You bum-bum (Haha), look at your broke ass (Yeah)
It's why you're a bum-bum (Why?) 'cause your shit is so ass (Yeah)
Syllable gun-guns (Chk-chk), spits and goes ""Hadoo"" (Doo)
Only L that I ever took was when I lost Proof (Yeah)
Only time that I ever got served is that lawsuit when Ma sued (What?)
But, bitch, get out of pocket and I might accost you (Accost you)
Homicides up the wazoo
(Chain) Chain gaudy, probably got more bodi-odi-odies than John do (John do)
Just called Snoop and I talked to him (What?), we all cool (Yeah)
Dre, me and the Dogg good, Doc, we got you
Got a castle with a solid gold floor (What?)
No I don't, I don't even got a boat nor
Do I got a chauffeur, but a lot to show for
You don't wanna fuck around and start no war (Nah)
Twenty more years, I could probably go for
Just like your lip and you got a cold sore
My shit is like motherfuckin' herpes
You ain't ever gonna say I don't got it no more (Bitch)
Literally it's no quittin' me, you kiddin' me?
Dying laughing is the only way you're killing me
I'm getting rid of ya, get clapped like chlamydia
The wittiest, bitch, I'll snap like a tibia
You wanna get silly with the bars? I'm frivolous
But I'm as gritty and litty as my city is
East side 'til I die, bitch, I will rep 'til the end like a chameleon
Got a killer instinct with the pen's ink and they're in sync like a faucet
How the fuck do I even think of this ridiculous shit?
I'm a quarter of a century deep and I can't be beat (Nah)
'Til the day me and the grim reap meet, I'm ten toes down 'til I'm six feet deep (What?)
Windows down in the Benz E jeep hollerin' at a bimbo, beep-beep-beep
She said she fucks with the M-T-B to the M-B: Side B Slim CD
I can see why you envy me, you get no ass like an empty seat (Haha)
So this shit comes with a warning for all of you punks and you corny

Twenty-five shows, check the pay out

Motherfuckers hate you when they lookin' for a way out (Sheesh)

She got her hair done, she finna need it redone (Damn)

Booked up, tell a dumb bitch, ""Read some"" (Bitch, read some)
I'm anointed, I'm the boss
I done came out of pocket so much (Woah)
You thought that I was disjointed (God)
They pointed me towards your diss
Um, I'm disappointed (Disappointed)
My ex treat me like I ain't there (There)
What happened to the feelings and love that we still share? (Huh?)
Just like the girls who got my name tatted and covered up
I know deep down, under the surface it's still there, still there (Yeah)[Chorus: Jack Harlow with Big Sean]
And she gon' let me hit it any day now, ooh
What you gon' say now? Ooh
Oh my, ex-girl got a bae now, ooh
But she still let me stay now, ooh

Twenty-five shows, check the pay out

Jack Harlow,Nail Tech by Jack Harlow,"[Intro]
Mm-mm, mm, mm-mm
Tss
[Verse 1]
My nail tech knows how to keep a lil' secret
I don't wish for my success, I speak it
I caught a buzz, and you did too, but you tweakin'
I look like I been gettin' money, I reek it
You smell me, that's LV
Walkin' 'round with my chest out, and my skin smooth, I'm healthy
I'm in the mix and I'm handshakin' but most of y'all can't help me (Nah)
Most of y'all ain't wealthy (Nope), most of y'all just dress like it
I caught the vibe that y'all givin' off, and I'm tryna make myself less like it
This chick got a lil' Porsche body, I might let the bro test drive it
It's hard for me to get excited, I love music, and stress 'bout it
My city haulin' and I'm cosigning this wave, comin' up next out it
Ridin' 'round and this shotgun in her Tesla
Hangin' both of my legs out of it
, like ""What's up?"" (What's up?)
I got stakes and they too high now, I can't fuck up (Can't fuck up)
I like girls that's down to Earth, so don't be stuck up (Stuck up)
I don't take Ls, I give 'em out and I chuck 'em up
First listen, they hearin' this shit like, ""What the fuck?""
[Pre-Chorus]
Ten toes, that's my MO
Fam' over 'Gram, that's my MO (On my momma)
Fuck a close friends, I got friends that I keep close
And they let it go while I reload
[Chorus]
Like baow, baow, baow
TSA just opened my book-bag up and my chain hittin' like
Baow, baow, baow, baow
The king's back in his hometown
, when them wheels hit and I touchdown they
Baow, baow, baow, baow
She down low, three point stance, I'm back there doin' Jack dance like
Baow, baow, baow, baow
[Verse 2]
And I'm not no fashionista, but I'm fly though (But I'm fly)
And I know I gave up drinkin', but I'm high though (But I'm high)
I told her, ""I don't cum from head, but you can try though"" (You can try)
I'm not on top of this shit yet, but I'm that guy though
I take a look 'round and my comp and it's just, uh (Ooh)
Wide open, big whippin', it slide open (Mm-mm)
I notice they treat me like I'm chosen (I'm chosen)
Eyes open, heart clean and my mind focused
This shit just keeps goin' how I wrote it
How the hell could you doubt us?
I mean, back then it made sense, but it's like, now what?
Now they down to come 'round just to be 'round us
You ain't one of my dawgs, why do you hound us?
It's very few of you I like, but it's a whole lot of y'all I don't trust
'Cause[Pre-Chorus]
Ten toes, that's my MO

Fuck a close friends, I got friends that I keep close

Girl, you look good, I would risk everything
Makе me forget what safe sеx is
I'ma finish right now if I don't take breaths in
I recommend you don't listen to your friends

Twenty-five deep in the same section

Tell me this ain't something that you do often
I can't say the same, so use caution (Use caution)

You can run around, I love the chase
If you need a break 'cause you're thirsty

In the club smokin' Jack Harlow's gas
But I'm about to do the drugs that Carlos has
Old Miami Vice, 'bout to AT4 it
But I don't show up if they don't pay me for it
New York, party on the eighteenth floor
But her ass so fat that I can't ignore it
Woo, I go crazy for it
But to ride the rides, you gotta be eighteen for it
No games, just some foreplay before it
And the sex so good, she wanna pay me for it, no

Yeah
Wheezy outta here
[Verse 1: Drake]
The dash, it's digi', the schedule busy
My head in a hoodie, my shorty a goodie
My cousins are crazy, my cousins like Boogie
Life is amazin', it is what it should be
Been here for ten but I feel like a rookie
I tell her, ""Look up"" 'cause it's snowin' in Tootsie's
Booked for three years, man, you can't even book me
It's me and Lil Baby, this shit goin' crazy
Wheezy produced it and Weezy F. made me
And she held it down, so she got a Mercedes
Young Money Records, the Army, the Navy
They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like, ""Yes, indeed""
[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Cartier glasses, I won't even peek at you
Yellow Ferrari like Pikachu
I got 'em waitin' and watchin' what he gon' do
Tryna peep what I do, tryna steal my moves
25 hundred for a new pair of tennis shoes
The same price, I could make them youngins come and finish you
Lawyer been chargin', he a Jewish like he voodoo
Real dope boy, hundred thousand in Evisu
Presidential tints slide by, we don't see you
I been gettin' money, I ain't worried 'bout what he do
I'm gettin' money like I'm from the '80s
Me and Drake 'bout to drop, man, this shit gon' go crazy
They know I'm the truth, comin' straight from the basement
I'm straight as the street, man I come from the pavement
A million, all hundreds, it make 'em go crazy
Wah-wah-wah, bitch, I'm the baby

Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please

You can get the biggest Chanel bag in the store if you want it
I gave 'em the drip, they sucked it up, I got 'em moanin'
I bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned 'em
Takin' these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the mornin'
That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it
If I'm in the club, I got that fire when I'm performin'
The backend just came in, in all hundreds
Vibes galore, cute shit, they all on us
I'm from Atlanta where young niggas run shit
I know they hatin' on me, but I don't read comments
Whenever I tell her to come, she comin'
Whenever it's smoke, we ain't runnin'
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind

Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave

Yeah, every other night, another dollar gettin' made
Every other night started with a good day
I feel like a child, I got boogers in the face
Diamonds dancin' in the dial like this shit is a parade
I don't want your chain, Young GonWunna not a slave
I had to draw the line, too many bitches gettin' saved
TSA harass me, so I took a private plane
These pussy niggas lackin', why I'm workin' on my aim
Drip too hard (Too hard), charge it to the card (To the card)
Designer to the ground, I can barely spell the names
Drip too hard, caution on the floor
You gon' fuck around and drown tryna ride a nigga wave[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Drip too hard, don't stand too close

We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (Everything)
I even went and bought her diamond rings, matching earrings
Everything was so cool (So cool)
Lately baby been actin' so rude (Been so rude)
I don't know what somebody told you (What they told you)

Know we be fuckin' 'fore I screwed you
Made a promise I won't use you
Play my cards right, I won't lose you
Got 'em tuned in like I'm YouTube
Got somethin' on me like it's voodoo
I'll go nuts for you, go cuckoo, lose my cool and all
And I know that shit was wrong, I shouldn't've did what I did
[Verse 2]
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you
Take me back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Take you back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't

Keep our business to ourselves
The internet ain't doin' no help
I know I shouldn't've never left
But everything I did for us
And us, I'm speakin' on my kids
Thinkin' 'bout this shit I did
Like how the hell I get myself involved in this bullshit?
Married to the game, I can't make you my fiancée
Bad young boss bitch, treat her like Beyoncé
But damn what them broads say, I fucked them all the first day
And that's why you trippin' anyway, like when I fuck 'em I don't pay
Even if we never speak again
I'll make sure you're ridin' in the latest Benz
Keep your business all apart if you can stay out of mine
Bought a brand new Audemars, but I done ran out of time[Chorus]

Geekin' off trees like a leaf in the fall
Find a new plug then we takin' em all
Pull up in a brand new Benz truck
Hop out fresher than a menthol
Lil' nigga, but I'm big, dawg
All I gotta make is one call
Get a nigga block, took off
Cross a nigga up, Hot Sauce
Ooh, I got 'em mad, my fault
Talkin' 'bout the shit that I bought
Poppin' these Percs, I done turned to a savage
Hundred racks stuffed in the mattress
Hundred racks stuffed in the attic
Hundred racks stuffed in the sofa
These niggas play gangster, but they won't approach me
I know they never approach me
They know that they'll catch a bullet
I rock the gang to the fullest
I run with some real ones, don't hang with no pussies
I ain't no killer, don't push me
I see how you niggas be lurkin'
I hope you don't think you no bully
I'm livin' the life, I should star in a movie
Ridin' in a Vert with an Uzi
12 get behind me, I lose 'em
They tryna guess what I'm doin'
They tryna guess who I'm screwin'
That ain't even they business
They ain't wanna fuck with me
Now they see a nigga drippin'
Now they wanna fuck with me
They can't get in touch with me
Hardly ever in the city
They just know I'm gettin' bigger
They just know a nigga busy

Protests and growing national outcry continues over the death of George Floyd
(
Section 8 just straight cooked this motherfucker up
)
Last night, people protesting in Minneapolis escalated
As demonstrators were lashed by tear gas and rubber bullets
The main message here, the main message here, the main message here
Is that they want to see those officers involved
They want to see those officers arrested
Officers arrested
(I can't breathe, I can't breathe)
[Verse 1]
Trade my 4x4 for a G63, ain't no more free Lil Steve
I gave 'em chance and chance and chance again, I even done told them please
I find it crazy the police'll shoot you and know that you dead, but still tell you to freeze
Fucked up, I seen what I seen
I guess that mean hold him down if he say he can't breathe
It's too many mothers that's grieving
They killing us for no reason
Been going on for too long to get even
Throw us in cages like dogs and hyenas
I went to court and they sent me to prison
My mama was crushed when they said I can't leave
First I was drunk, then I sobered up quick
When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb
He got a life sentence plus
We just some products of our environment
How the fuck they gon' blame us?
You can't fight fire with fire
I know, but at least we can turn up the flames some
Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
I be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces
Fucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better, you gotta know how to survive
Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones to carry a gun when they going outside
Stare in the mirror whenever you drive
Overprotective, go crazy for mine
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Seem like the blind following the blind
Thinking 'bout everything that's going on
I boost security up at my home
I'm with my kind if they right or they wrong
I call him now, he'll pick up the phone
And it's five in the morning, he waking up on it
Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us
While they go home at night, that shit messed up
Knowing we needed help, they neglect us
Wondering who gon' make them respect us
I can see in your eye that you fed up
Fuck around, got my shot, I won't let up
They know that we a problem together
They know that we can storm any weather
[Chorus]
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
[Verse 2]
Fuck it, I'm goin' on the front line
He gon' bust your ass if you come past that gun line
You know when the storm go away, then the sun shine
You gotta put your head in the game when it's crunch time
I want all my sons to grow up to be monsters
I want all my daughters to show out in public
Seems like we losing our country
But we gotta stand up for something, so this what it comes to
Every video I see on my conscience
I got power, now I gotta say somethin'
Corrupted police been the problem where I'm from
But I'd be lying if I said it was all of them
I ain't do this for the trend, I don't follow them
Altercations with the law, had a lot of them
People speaking for the people, I'm proud of them
Stick together, we can get it up out of them
I can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope, but I'm telling my youngins to vote
I did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope, I was forced to just jump in and go
This bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change
Got time to be serious, no time for no games
We ain't takin' no more, let us go from them chains
God bless they souls, every one of them names[Chorus]
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
[Verse 3]
They trainin' officers to kill us, then shootin' protestors with these rubber bullets
They regular people, I know that they feel it
These scars too deep to heal us
What happened to COVID? Nobody remember
It ain't makin' sense, I'm just here to vent
It happen to one of your people, it's different
We get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it
Knowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness, I know that I'm gifted
I won't go too deep 'cause I'm scared they'll get me
Ain't scared to admit it, some shit I can't mention
It's people who can, well, here's the chance
I won't take the stand, but I'll take a stand for what I believe
Must not be breathing the air that I breathe
You know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed
I never been a fan of police
But my neighborhood know I try to keep peace
So it's only right that I get in the streets
March for a reason, not just on GP
Our people died for us to be free
Fuck do you mean? This was a dream
Now we got the power that we need to have
They don't want us with it and that's why they mad, yeah[Chorus]
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year

I'ma turn it up a lil' more this time
Used to dream about gettin' it, now I got it, I don't drive
I had a spot like The Varsity, what'll you have?
You buy twenty, I'll front what you buy
I put on drip, I believe I can I fly
Niggas know that I'm rich, but they know not to try
I had a show in Detroit and I stopped at Revive
And spent fifty on all of the guys
All of these hoes in these stores make commission
And plus I'ma tip 'em, they holdin' my size
Get in your car and just put on your flashers
And follow the hearse since you say you gon' ride
'Cause somebody gon' die if they fuck with us
Turn a five to a dime, that's a double up
Fuck around, walk through church with my double cup
This shit a habit, I'm prayin' I give it up
Tiger stay with the wood, make 'em give it up
Know I ran through a mil' every week coppin' weed
Bruh beat the charge, I can get me some sleep
Got a backend to pick up, I won't even leave
Run it up, fuck around, give the 'Vette to DT
Keep a hotboy with me, I got love for BG
Chasin' this paper since twelve or thirteen
Runnin' 'round in these streets, it was me and Marquise[Chorus: 42 Dugg & Lil Baby]

Fill the bando up with bags, give the lil' bro them a job
You can come get rich with us, you gon' eat or you gon' starve?
Keep a certified hitter sittin', I pay him not to rob
Hop out 2020 Cullinan, I'm ridin' in the stars
Know some people hate that I'm on top, I bulletproofed the car
All the members made free bands off packs, live like they crackin' cards
Joe know for a fact I keep it real, he still ain't take the charge
Why she talkin' crazy 'bout me like I don't do more than my part?
I can't play with my creation, give the world to my lil' boys
I been savin' more than I been spendin', that's what I bе on
I'm a human, I'm not perfect, I know sometimеs I be wrong

I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hundred rounds in the double drum, this a Kel-Tec
Marco been in prison for a while, but he still flex
[Verse 2]
I told brodie 'nem to park the car, but they still wrecked
I don't think nobody around steal, but I still check
I don't got a hundred mil' yet, I can't chill yet
But don't get it misconstrued, yeah, I get real checks
Baby fuckin' like a pornstar, we have real sex
Have nobody in our business, we take Learjets
Say she like when I perform, so I fuck her with my chains on
And she handlin' her part, so I let her play the main role
Ain't have to get rich for these partners, still with the same folks
And I can't beef with none of you niggas, not in the same boat
I'm never gon' get caught up about it, know how the game go
Tennis chain bustin', look like rainbows

Uh
[Chorus: J. Cole]
Pride is the Devil
Think it got a hold on me
Pride is the Devil
It left so many R.I.P.
Pride is the Devil
Think it got a hold on me
Pride is the Devil, yeah, uh
[Post-Chorus: J. Cole]
Terrified, paranoid, I'll put you over everything to fill the void
And when you’re gone, will I have anything or will I be destroyed
? Uh
Terrified, paranoid, I'll put you over everything to fill the void
And when you're gone, will I have anything or will I be destroyed? Yеah
[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Bright lights pass me in the city, it’s emеrgency
I'm thankful 'cause I made it past my thirties, no one murdered me
Still remember vividly the nigga that pulled a gun on me
I'm petrified, but moving like I got no sense of urgency
Pride make a nigga act way harder than he really be
Pride hide the shame when city cut off all utilities
Pride hide the pain of growing up inhaling poverty
Pride make a nigga feel a way that you unfollowed me
Make a nigga flash a thousand like he hit the lottery
Make a baby mama make shit harder than it gotta be
Make you have to take the bitch to court to see your prodigy
Make you have to use your last resort and pull a robbery
Pride be the reason for the family dichotomy
Got uncles and some aunties that's too proud to give apologies
Slowly realizing what the root of all my problems be
It got me feeling different when somebody say they proud of me
[Chorus: J. Cole]
Pride is the Devil, uh
I think it got a hold on me
Pride is the Devil, uh
It left so many R.I.P.
Pride is the Devil
I think it got a hold on me
Pride is the Devil, uh, yeah[Post-Chorus: J. Cole]
Terrified, paranoid, I'll put you over everything to fill the void
And when you're gone, will I have anything or will I be destroyed?
Uh
Terrified, paranoid, I'll put you over everything to fill the void
And when you’re gone, will I have anything or will I be destroyed? Yeah
[Bridge: J. Cole]
Too much money to count, what’s the amount?
Check never bounce
I gotta pay a nigga to add it up
Then pay somebody to make sure whatever amount he say he can back it up
Got racks on racks, I'm rackin’ up, stackin' up
You're reachin', I’m actin' up
[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Break it down, weigh it up, now bag it up
Making five a month, that's regular
Nigga playing with us, that's a negative
Go back to start, that's never
I'm a boss, my closet leather
Ain't no off-days on my schedule
Long as I live, we live forever
Told my twin this shit get better
These niggas done slipped, let me ahead 'em
Got my feet up, I paid silly bands to have sex on the jet
I don't need 'em, that shit in the past, I'm feelin' like what's next
Got my speed up, foot all on the gas, this not a C8 'Vette
I can beat 'em, I believe in me, just tell me what's the bet
All my pride gone, had to lose it all then I got rich
I own five homes, glad some of this shit starting to make sense
I'm staying hella focused and I can't forget the bigger picture
I can't even hold you, I didn't have shit, I won't forget it
Will I be destroyed?
Come to me with everything, it's starting to get annoying
I'm addicted to promethazine, it's crazy, yeah, I know it
All this money coming in, it drive me crazy not to show it
I'll be crazy if I blow it[Chorus: J. Cole]
Pride is the Devil, uh
I think it got a hold on me
Pride is the Devil, uh
And it left so many R.I.P.
Pride is the Devil
I think it got a hold on me

Lil Baby,Nuketown by Ski Mask the Slump God (Ft. Juice WRLD),"[Verse 1]
A love letter came through the mail, it said, ""I miss you""
I ripped it up and flushed with the tissue, try to forget you
I ain't got nothing against you, we human, we all got issues
But I'm tired of being tired of being tired
That part of me done died
I see it, then I don't, act like I'm blind
I'm confident it won't be one of mine
I know emotions come with lies, so I tell the truth all the time
Ain't got no sympathy for no bitch
I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit
Jumpin' up on stages, I get two hundred an occasion
Bro had really fucked the game up, we made niggas shut they trap down
They see how I made it, I'm the reason they won't rap now
See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down
The biggest OG's salute me, a stylist can't even style me
The robbers probably wanna get me, I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis
The youngins turn in my city, they try me, I get it cracking
Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping
My people them still steady trapping and they still be getting active
I tell 'em to chill, I'm tryna run up these M's
Paid cash and
then he post the crib
(Nah)
I can't show nobody where my mama live, that's how I 'posed to feel
My niece just asked me were my diamonds real, I said, ""Of course""
I just played the hand that I was dealt, didn't have to force
All around the world they know it's me, they hear my voice
And I done it all in a pair of Diors, yeah
[Chorus]
Young age, learned how to get paid (We gon' get the money)
Big stage, long way from Section 8 (Ballin' other countries)
Big wave, he gon' have to get saved (Big old wave)
Ridin' in the foreign, chiefin' on the forest
I know I wasn't there for you, at least I said I'm sorry
You know what it was, I told you that I was heartless
I'm emotionally scarred, that ain't even your fault
But don't listen to them haters tryna fill your ears with salt
[Verse 2]
All this revenue coming in, I'll probably never spend
I just bought my BM a Benz, now that's another Benz
I just cut off all of my friends and brought my brothers in
I don't see nobody but me, who I'm gon' lose to?
I can't move around without tools, these niggas loose screws
I can see me taking the lead over the new school
They remember me from selling weed at my old school
Only hit it once and now it's old news
Blew up, who the fuck would knew?
Paint my Trackhawk Nipsey Blue
If I get one, you get one too, I really move how bosses move
I never call myself a G.O.A.T., I leave that up to the people
Everybody can't go to the top, I had to leave some people
I'ma be forever scheming, woke up, I thought I was dreaming
Watched my lil' boy play with toys, I just dropped a tear of joy
Some shit that I feel for
I been going crazy with that scoring, call me Baby Harden
They say I'll be great, I guess I'm waiting for it[Chorus]
Young age, learned how to get paid (We gon' get the money)

He ain't me, you can keep the comparisons
My bitch probably one of the baddest
Good girl, turned her into a savage
Dispatch, got a problem in traffic
We came through in matching G-Wagens
Low-key, I've been keeping it classy
Could be really out here doin' 'em nasty
Niggas couldn't even see me in last year

She know how I get when I get in that mode
Ain't fuckin' with bitches, ain't buying no clothes
Wanna do shows and make me some songs
Make sure that other shit come in, get sold
We fuck with the strippers 'cause we play with poles
We play with our money and not with our nose
I used to go to the West to get loads
I just came back from the West with a trophy
I'm on some more shit
She said she miss it and sendin' emojis
No time to kick it, I'm always in motion
Can't say I miss you, I don't got emotions
I'm on that back-when-I slept-on-the-floor shit
I'm on that me-and-the-bro-kick-a-door shit

Ain't goin' broke, I'm just back on my old shit

Your bitch wanna fuck 'cause I'm Swervo

My name's Swervo 'cause I be the G (G Herbo)
Used to do shows for a G
Came from toting gats over east
I'ma spend 30 racks on a piece
[Verse 1]
G Swervo, I keep a meat roll
Dracos under the peacoat
Heard the police was looking for me though
But I'm on a PJ with Squeezo
Remember I was just living illegal
Now the kids look at me like a hero
Told them I was just like 'em once before
Now my account got some commas and zeros
We ain't living on welfare no more
Im eating steak at the bistro
Foreign coupe with a red head lil ho
Lemme pull on her hair while she deepthroat
And I'm from Chiraq where it go down
Young nigga sheisty and low down
I'ma pull up and aim at your forehead
I took a foot shot with a four-oh round
Yeah you know I bounce back with that lil shot
Shit if you ask me it was a good shot
I'm from the 9, sendin' shots straight to the 5
Yeah I'ma call it a hook shot
And when I ride, 40 Glock right by my side
Fly past your whip, get your hood shot
Find out where a nigga hang, slide with the gang
Fuck around get your whole hood shot[Chorus]

Two door with my bitch, me, her, and my stick
She tryna suck my dick, we got limo tint
And the Posto lit, AC out the vent
Traphouse pay the rent, P serves off the Sprint
Rap pay my mama rent, YouTube pay my ho rent
Merch will pay your ho rent, iTunes pay some more shit
Humble Beast, that's Herbo, Swervo talk that dope shit
Swervo talk that cash shit, money in that bag shit
Spent two K for these Versace glasses, on my swag shit
They call me Swervo 'cause I did that when I crashed my last whip[Chorus]

Southside,Swervo by G Herbo & Southside,"[Intro]
Scared I wasn't gon' make it home some nights
Wondering, ""Am I gon' be a homicide?""
Kill you quick if I decide
Crazy, guess I get that from my mama side
Niggas beef with us, don't even come outside
30 in the Glock, I keep that on my side
Ain't no questioning, my nigga, I'ma ride (Southside)
Out there like some monkey bars, I'ma slide
I know one day I'ma die
Made some millions for my son so I'm a'ight
And I'm in that Bentley truck that's parked right outside
I know one day I'ma die, but right now I'm alive
Need a Purple Heart for the shit that I survived
Better be alert if ever you and I collide
And I ain't limiting myself to shit, I gotta strive
It look like a light show when I arrive (ChopsquadDJ on the beat, so it's a banger)
[Verse]
Straight up out the trenches
Had to squeeze that bitch least one time
Me and all my niggas
We was young and dumb, I ain't know how to fucking listen
So pay attention, hopefully I get to teach you different
All you young niggas wild 'til you meet the district
He ain't even get due process and this nigga snitching
Get around a nigga like me and they turn bitches
He ain't never did no street shit, I see through him instantly
Gotta take everything come with this shit, you gon' be like that
Gotta have that bail money, gotta be ready to fight that
Blood ties with my niggas, I got shot with Project
Mally, he was with me, too, but we did dirt on top of that
My left pocket, wasn't no phone in it, my baby Glock in there
Summer Jam in front of 20,000, I wish Roc was there
Seen't you in there witcho bop, you know I got the top from her
Anyway, that's off the topic
We talking 'bout them blocks, shootouts, and Glocks
And what about the opps?
Shit, what 'bout the opps?
Shit, what 'bout they bops?
What pop out they top?
Gang, you know how we rock
In clubs, am I not?
At shows, am I not?
Iced up, am I not?
Amiri's with knots
I ain't hard to find
All you gotta do is apply
I'm ready when you are
Riding back to back, two blacks, we like the mini bar
Lotta shots, keep one up top, send them bitches at any car
Ayy, ayy
And I'm on the E-way like Andretti, my new car
Loaded like I'm ready for Armageddon
Boy, I came too far to let a nigga take me out this shit, now he a star
Nigga make me a block
Nigga make me a bar
I'm all in his raps, smokin' me in his cigar
I know a nigga so cold, he shoot at the opps out his sister car
And it's over a bitch, your life ain't worth that pussy boy
Know you been getting played out all yo life, you pussy boy
2Pac told you first, ""I ain't no killer, but don't push me"", boy
So don't push me, boy
You know I'm gon' pull it boy
Here go a bullet, I ain't a bully
My auto fully
I rep that No Limit shit to the fullest
Hop out in public, I'm thinking 'bout leaving the blick out
I'ma tote my lil' shit in a hoodie
Came up from nothing, I still can't believe I'm legit
Everywhere I go I'm the shit
Been out here swaggin' like I'm that nigga ever since I was six
Ain't gotta ask a nigga for shit 'cause I'm fucking rich
Ain't nobody give me nothing
Want a handout? Suck a dick

Southside,Some Nights by G Herbo & Southside,"[Intro]
Yeah
You know, this a letter to my son
I had to write off the pad 'cause I done broke my phone
I ain't even gon' get another one honestly
I don't even care 'bout that type of stuff no more
That's slow stuff, it don't even matter
I got a shorty on the way so
[Verse 1]
I gotta change my ways
Might as well start to watch what I say
I grew up a bad example
Lately I can't smoke where I lay
I don't wanna set bad examples
All good, ain't no smoke with my lady
We at peace in the house burning sages
She just walking around saying prayers
In a few months, you'll be here in April
Brand new room for you, right now we making it
Even though I know you'll never stay in it
On the 48th floor where we staying at, that's just my lil' way of saying we making it
Daddy still gotta go hard to stay with it
Family all out of harm's way, we safe with it
Don't spend no more, lock the safe up, we saving it
Just so you straight, ain't it
I give you all that I can
Teach you all of the things that I learned on my own, but they minee me a man
You ain't gotta grow up in the streets like I did, I lost the bestest of friends
I did make sacrifices for them
I did everything for everybody but myself and I felt like less of a man
Ain't gotta tote gats on Essex again
Lord sent a blessing, amen
Mama ain't stressing, amen
Put family first as long they do the best that they can
Just watch for the snakes, everybody that hate, wanna smile in yo face and watch what you make
Just 'cause you born great, in the womb eating steak
Car seats in the Wraith and estates
Yeah, I bought yo mama a Range, 90K
I bought my mama a Benz, 60K
Just got pulled over in that Bentley today
Police trying to talk to me, ain't nothing to say, ay
I was just brought up that way
My dad taught me that at a very young age
Say, I want my lawyer today
Say, I want my father today (okay)
Everyday saw my Dad I was still on that A
Rebelled on my father, dived in that water
He
instilled fear in me everyday
The more older I got, the less I did what he say
Ain't trying to teach you that way
I ain't trying to beat you I ain't, I'm gonna give you the game
Can't wait to see your lil face and meet you
I love you, you came from the blood of my vein
Give you food out my belly, clothes off my back
Plan your whole future I spend every stack
Hustle to get every bag, hustler, when you of age I'll tell you 'bout that
[Verse 2]
Just so you can understand my life
I got tired of wrong and started doing what's right
Ain't no more pouring codeine in my sprite
And now I'm just up until 6 every night
No question, for you I'ma ride
Play with my kid, homicide
All that bullshit to the side
I'ma be there 'til I die
And when I die, I'ma still be right there with you, just hold your head to the sky
All you see red in mine
But it won't be no pain in your eyes
That's why I'm here to wash away your cries
G-Fazos in every size
My lil niggas swag gotta match mine
Baby, rollie time if I'm shining, then you shine
Daddy on the grind, ain't gon be there all the time
Make your Momma happy, I don't see mine all the time
Things people say I don't believe all the time
That's cause someone using me all the time
Only people I put my trust in is mine
Only people I'm stuck with is mine
And I only got money for mine
It ain't too much my money can't buy
My limit's the sky, this like a letter to mine
You ain't gotta come up and make all those stupid decisions like I
Ain't gotta thug to survive
I sold drugs to survive
Hurt some of my love ones, I lied
Me and my big cousin is fine
Still holding grudges in mind
Life too short son, just take your losses and ride
Life super short, son I'm just happy I'm alive[Outro]
Yeah
It's crazy man, I'm finna have my first born son
You know we only raise young kings and queens, ya know what I'm saying
Gotta bring my son up how I was raised even better times 10
This for everybody trying to stay focused
Do you to provide for your family, ya know
Like I'm trying to do this for my family
Cause nothing gon' come from my family
I’ll lay down right now and die for  my son and I ain't even ever met him
I'm out here ya know, protecting my girl, my girl can't even go to the grocery store right now while she pregnant
She can't fuck, she can't do nothing right now she pregnant"

8-8-8-8...
It's five in the morning in this bitch
[Verse]
Can't believe I made it
Used to wake up get faded
This Hollywood shit was foreign to me like I just hopped off the slave ship
These niggas signing two million dollars, 360 deals
Getting on some slave shit
Popped out on the opps with the Glock in my hand like, ""fuck it""
I was on some brave shit
Me and lil' bro hop out, blaze shit
We ain't need no special occasion
Now I go do two shows and come home with 80, this shit brazy
This street shit out here changing
Niggas signing affidavits
Want beef with me?
I'm supposed to be a street nigga, street nigga how I played it
I was on the block daily, 'fore I got famous
77th to 79th, Yates to Kingston, it was all Rangers
8 A.M. we up, on the way to target practice, them was our ranges
Them lil' No Limit niggas, stay away from em, they ass dangerous
They don't need no anger, they'll kill a stranger
aim
We ain't shoot from no angle, put that bitch in your brain, boy
Bang, boy
Gang gang, boy
Exotic pack, new thing boy
It's going down in Illinois
Them boys shooting like Villanova
Ballin' like Kobe
Herbo, what you do?
Get bored, hit Saks, spend 24
Swervo, why you ain't got no feelings? 'Cause I'm gangsta to the core
Perc' 30 make me fuck 'til she sore
Gotta go get a Plan B from the store
'Cause I just had a lil' boy, closet got more Gucci drip than yours
Keep at least a lil' 50 ball in the drawer
Withdraw 100, deposit 4
Ain't gotta look over my shoulder no more
We went way, way up on the score
My crib way, way up on the floor
Like 50 of them bitches above yours
And I get right off the plane, hop in the foreign, bonjour
Pull up in a foreign, bonjour
Who got a Bentley sprinter? I'ma take that bitch on tour
Who got a new Draco? I'ma take that bitch on tour
Just got a brand new money counter, I'ma take that bitch for sure
They tryna ride my wave, they gon' take that bitch to shore
I'm living thug life like 2Pac Shakur
Swervo, you always rap about 2Pac Shakur
See you in the black Benz, I hope you got that Glock in yours
Niggas ain't taking care of business, you on top of yours
These hoes fucking up they paper, they ain't stopping yours
Bought a portable studio, I'ma take that bitch on tour
(All these niggas new shit trash, when you dropping yours?)
Everybody claiming they in they bag, when you gon' hop in yours?
Oh you in the Jag'? I ride G12
Fuck is that, a Ford?
Laughing at the rear view, high speed with the Jakes
Fuck is that, a Ford?
Soon as we jumped on the E-way, they ain't even wanna chase no more
But I ain't been to the hood, they don't see my face no more
This shit got way too good to be true, I wasn't fighting the case no more
Fuck would you do? Chiraq ain't safe no more
Lost Cap, I can't holla at my ace no more
Mad zips to the face no more
Had Porsches and
[?]
straight did dirt out accords, switch whips, hit Lakeshore
Seen what happened to that boy, I had to pour a four
Deuces wasn't doing shit for me no more, I had to pour a four
Sodas and juices wasn't doing shit for me no more, I had to pour up raw
That shit get the best of me and I be riding snoring
Wake up, think 'bout my dawgs
Next thing I know I'm dropping some more
I was 18, riding foreigns, bonjour
Fucking cougars, would've tried to put this dick in some more
Still was fucking bitches my age, might've put dick in your daughter
Some days was broke as fuck
No homo, had my dick in the floor
Had to get shit in order
30 in the Ruger clip, I wish that bitch had some more in there
VV's in the Dweller, look like I hit that bitch in some water
BD, GD, Stone, whatever
Get some money, 'cause I ain't have a quarter
Long Live that nigga Zack TV, heard he had a daughter
The police here ain't solving murders, this ain't Law & Order

It's G Herbo, baby
And I come straight from the blizzock
Luckily I ain't a felon, but I got caught with the glizzock
And I just bought me a white Sky Dweller, finna bust down my wrist watch
2018 my year watch
Bitch, I'm only flying from the clear, watch
Yeah, that's the jet, so I travel with the Tec
When I land, put the engine in the rear, watch
And we back to back, Bentley's all matte black
Hit the sport, throw that bitch up in the gear, ah!
I heard it's some trappers in here, huh
What you make this year?
Anyway, it's some hammers in here, pistol clappers in here, kidnappers in here
We just got left in the jungle and turned to some animals
Bitch, we adapters in here
Pull up shooting shit from mid-range, bitch we Toronto Raptors in here
Mama told me, ""can't live in fear""
I changed the atmosphere, ayy
Nigga I ain't drunk that Act' in a year
Only if Cap was here

I don't talk that shit, I'll end niggas rap career
I was in the streets too much and it held me back for real
I was in the the trap for real
I hit 175 racks for real
Still ride with them straps for real
But I'll beat the streets, I ain't going back for real
Blick on my lap for real, for real
And it's a known fact for real
Get killed 'bout Kobe and Cap for real
Pull up, blast for real (brrat)
We sold crack for real (crack)
In the stu', strapped for real (strapped)
Lil' Herb back for real (back)

Niggas is bitch
No homo, but my Glock got a dick
20 plus, four or more
I used to get all the way up and go broke
Said to myself I ain't doing that no more
Walk ups on niggas, glide slow low
Jedi blow four from the .44
Might as well let off the .2, ain't got no more
On the way home, it's 12 on go though
Big 40 hollows, spin like hollows
Fully auto, shoot up your car door
Racks on me now like I just hit the lotto
Ain't in the hood no more, but I'm not far though
Bitch I'm sauced up, taco
Bossed up, El Chapo
Built for war right now though
That bitch be ready where I go
Nigga what's that, Posto (Posto!)
Reeking up my clothes, ayy
What it say on my clothes?
Givenchy, Leonardo
Never sold my soul
All my show sold
All these niggas hoes
Here go a bullet hole[Chorus]

If you a real live gangsta ass nigga, throw your shit up

All them drill niggas with us
Everybody got a gun, pussies still will get hit up
And
I'm still with that shit
I just be chill, tryna fill up
Got that 40 riding E all in the field, need a fill up
And I'm really chasing mill's
Nigga, I'm just being real
Everybody running wild now
I'm just being still
Unless I'm still on the road, or I'm still gone off a pill
And I don't got a deal
I don't have to offer some meals, I'm eating for real
Soon as I walk in the building, everybody in there could tell I'm eating for real
Just by the way that I talk, probably the way that I walk
I don't even floss
Leave you with some of this sauce
Teach you to learn from a loss and look like a boss
Everybody won't pay that cost
This YSL, not Hugo Boss
I'm high as hell, I'm finna cough
Folks is coughing up a storm
Get that seed, had to swallow
We was fools, eating, selling all that food
Shout out Ralo
Fuckboy
, boy don't make the news
Front yo move, catch a hollow
If them people question me 'bout anything, hell if I know
I just had court yesterday, I get depressed whenever I go
But I still gotta wake up and get fresh whenever I go
I got swag like I'm Capo
, I know
[Chorus]
Everybody think I'm rich now
Everybody think I'm a bitch, huh?
You don't think I'm still with that shit now
You think I'm scared to pull this bitch, huh?
You was really barely in that shit, huh?
You ain't never have to blow yo stick, huh?
You really tryna get to know that bitch, huh?
You know she be sniffing coke and shit, huh?
On the road and shit, huh?
Using most that shit, huh?
Always broke and shit, huh?
Never post that shit, huh?
I'ma die a gangsta
And you know that shit, huh?
Death before dishonor, nigga
And you know that's it, huh?
[Verse 2]
I'm still with that shit, bitch
Blick still in my whip, bitch
And I'm riding automatic, bitch this ain't no stick shift
And you know I switch clips, like I switch whips
Bank been seeing me like all week, this my sixth trip
I been smoking Posto all day, this my last zip (Posto!)
Walking 'round with that Kriss Vector, make his ass flip
I ain't want his blood on my hands, so his ass crip
Herbo, run along, that's my mans, get ya ass kilt
Herbo been alone, where he been? Running up them bands
Niggas sleeping 'way all they days, fucking with them xans
And I gotta whole lotta grand, but I'm not the man
Niggas lose it all for the 'Gram, bet that wasn't the plan
And I do it all for the fam, and then for the fans
I done been through failure and all, that made me a man
I done been through hell with my dawgs and I'll go again
And they want more smoke again, we let 'em know again
And go to the store again, they just bought four again
Won't tote no .44 again
I'll blow an F&N
I thought I was flexing and I wrecked up tryna floor the Benz
Swervo (Swervo, you know what the fuck is up, 958, bitch)[Chorus]
Everybody think I'm rich now
Everybody think I'm a bitch, huh?
You don't think I'm still with that shit now
You think I'm scared to pull this bitch, huh?
You was really barely in that shit, huh?
You ain't never have to blow yo stick, huh?
You really tryna get to know that bitch, huh?
You know she be sniffing coke and shit, huh?
On the road and shit, huh?

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
These ain't no Guess jeans
I dropped out of school, I'm still good at math, but, nigga, don't test me
I played to the left, they went to the right, they tried to finesse me
Still riding 'round with that blicky, I hope they don't catch me
Police had raided our spot, so we went to the next street
Play like I'm dumb, as soon as it pop, I'm goin' retarded
He say I'm hard and he say I'm garbage, I'm rich regardless
We in Miami in the middle of the winter, and we on them jet skis
If we in Atlanta, I'm runnin' the 'Cat and I'm workin' the red key
[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
I cannot mention my homies inside of my song 'cause I know they be trappin' a lot
I can't keep takin' these pills, when I'm in the trenches, they say I be cappin' a lot
I know a nigga who say he got rich off the dope, but I know he be actin' a lot
I know some niggas who said that they took down the city, but niggas be lackin' a lot
Yeah
That shit was awful, nigga had that
dog food
That day they shot you, I slid on a Mongoose
You cannot come back around me, you turned your back on me, I cannot forget
The police was lyin', they say that they caught you, but nigga, they made you admit
Your name was found, you put in that work, they took your stick, you a bitch
Fuck my opps, they be on my dick, they all be mad we rich (Turn up)
[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Only twenty-five, livin' like a boss, ridin' 'round with a chauffeur
I don't sell drugs, still be paranoid, keep lookin' over my shoulder
Niggas lyin' like I'm stealin' swag, boy, that's my shit like I wrote it
[Verse 3: Polo G]
Uh
These rappers really nice as hell
I'm a different nigga when I'm pissed off
Man, he say he gon' press up on who?
I'ma get the steel like I'm Chris Paul
Back to back suburbans, I'm a big dawg
I was in the slums servin' Fentanyl
Zombieland, junkies havin' withdrawals
I been gettin' to it, lotta missed calls
Turn it off, what the fuck is he talking 'bout?
I should slap you for sayin' he hot as me
I don't know who could fuck with me honestly
They know I'm the man, so they watchin' me
Different color bands like Monopoly
Man, he must not be usin' his head
If he thinkin' I don't keep a Glock with me
That's like suicide if you play with us
Got a better chance at the lottery
Call an ambulance when that chopper sweep
Make the crowd dance, choreography
Once I got a plan, ain't no stoppin' me
Three-car garage, million-dollar crib
With a foreign bitch ridin' on top of me
Lot of people done said I wouldn't be shit
Well, I guess they owe me an apology[Chorus: Lil Baby]
These ain't no Guess jeans
I dropped out of school, I'm still good at math, but, nigga, don't test me

Lil Durk,Broadway Girls by Lil Durk (Ft. Morgan Wallen),"[Intro: Morgan Wallen & Lil Durk]
2 AM at a Broadway bar
She's puttin’ her number in my phone (Broadway girls alone)
Two Bud Lights deep, and she's sayin' things she don’t mean
And you know
[Verse 1: Morgan Wallen]
I met her down at Aldean's
She said that she saw me walkin' in about a mile away
Bean just had to take her phone and that just took her smile away
She said I'm too drunk and crazy, she don't like the way I dance
I said, ""You don't have to join in,"" she said she'd take a chance
I've been kinda crazy ever since it went down
I get kind of lost, and, baby, this what I found
Girls like you just wanna take me around, around and around
[Chorus: Morgan Wallen & Lil Durk]
Oh, there’s two things that you’re gonna find out
They don't love you and they only love you right now
If I was smarter, I’da stayed my ass at home
And leave them Broadway girls alone (Leave 'em alone, leave 'em alone)
Them Broadway girls alone (Leave 'em alone, leave ’em alone)
Leave them Broadway girls alone
[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
They town just told me, ""Don't trust 'em""
Broadway girls a trap
They on me, they tryna finesse me
They see me with Morgan and know that I rap
My horse is Porsches, turnin' me on
I jump on a horse, she get on the back
I went to the bar to go buy her a drink
She listen to P!nk, she told me she not into rap
I can't run out of money
The trenches love me forever
They treat me like Ed in London
Take her to pool, then got a beer for nothin'
Tecovas boots, guitar, cigar, the bar
She ridin' a bull like cars, she usually don't cool with stars

Now, there's two things that you're gonna find out
They don't love you and they only love you right now
If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Have you ever met a Chi-Town nigga?
Girl I heard you need a go-getter
You ain't never meet a rapper with the swag of a savage and a dope dealer
I'm the realest nigga that you see
I know you tired of them broke niggas
Heard he bought you a bag for a G
Why you fuckin' with them broke niggas?
Ginger ale and a fifth of liquor
Where you going, girl? I'm going with ya
Ride with me 'cause I'm number one
Two bitches, Malcolm in the middle
Fly to Vegas, bet life
Legs in the air, call it ""jet life""
Shawty give me top with the neck like
Shit gave me life, I can't get right, I can't get right
[Verse 2: Jeremih]
Got you jacuzzi water on a hundred
Got your tempo on a hundred, let it bubble up (Bubble up, bubble up, bub)
Need a bad bitch, tryna be a bad girl
You know I'm tryna trouble up (You know, I'm tryna trouble up, shawty)
Buy everything she wants two times, baby, double up (Know you really want it)
Say she need more niggas out here like me 'cause there's not enough (Not enough, not enough, no, no)
[Chorus: Jeremih]
She don't know about real niggas, she don't know no boss
She don't know about foreign cars, she don't what that cost
She don't know about love, she don't know what that is
She don't know about riding 'round and spending it like this (Now she wanna fuck)
Fuck with a nigga like me, wanna fuck with a nigga like me
Now she wanna fuck
Fuck with a nigga like me, wanna fuck with a nigga like me
Hit the club with a nigga like me
Do drugs with a nigga like me
Fall in love with a nigga like me
And never love another nigga, never love another nigga like me
(Me, me)[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
You ain't never been in my town, nigga
A good place to go but the murder rate's so ridiculous
Fell in love with some R&B bitch
And I know that it's good for the fame and for the image
Shawty gave me head like a penny
But she should go gold
Ain't really been in love in a minute
It won't hurt if no one know 'bout me
Fuck a bag off
No makeup, you look better with your mask off
Rich nigga wanna buzz, like to brag y'all
But a nigga like me, ain't no nigga like me
I'm a Boss, Hugo
Rich nigga since birth, you know
You my bitch don't get mad, Cujo
Nigga like me, I'm that nigga, nigga
Gettin' money since a little nigga
Shawty thinks she the shit, but she could be a lil' thicker
Fuck on my name and a little liquor
I got 'em pissed, I'm the shit, nigga
So why do they hate? I gotta get cake
These niggas so fake
So stay out my way (My way)
Ain't too many niggas like me[Chorus: Jeremih]
She don't know about real niggas (Yeah), she don't know no boss
She don't know about foreign cars, she don't what that cost
She don't know about love, she don't know what that is
She don't know about riding 'round and spending it like this (Now she wanna fuck)
Fuck with a nigga like me, wanna fuck with a nigga like me
Now she wanna fuck
Fuck with a nigga like me, wanna fuck with a nigga like me
Hit the club with a nigga like me

And nigga, I been goin' hard without a red pill
I dare my opponent try to cross me, nigga, Rico did
And we ain't tryna button no coat, we got crack, though
And I heard you got a shooter he like Shaq, though

We go gang, got my pants baggy, just like back then
Walk 'em down with a pump, like I'm tryna hunt somethin'
Stick gotta kick on that bitch, tryna punch somethin'

Didn't hold me down, they tried they best to try to hold me up
I seen this before, I think I'm workin' on my third life
Drive that Lambo how I want, I just took it through the red light
I come out that gutter where it ain't no love at
Where niggas kill they homies that they growed up with
But never killed an opp, that's just some shit I don't get
Nigga tried to up on Wop, got hit up with his own blick
If it ain't on me, it's close to me, I know niggas'll snake me
Get my homie back for these diamonds, I promise I'll take it
Brand new foreigns all through the hood to see my auntie
Know she love to see me shinin', yeah, yeah

Drop down to his knees about a hunnit times
And he was taught the right way
He got the chance and took the other side
He wake up think n pray
Then say he straight {?} ain't a homicide
Stressin bout the bills, he feel like damn he gotta help out
Had to step up at a young age cause his pops decide to step out
Angеr in his body, seen his brother body stretched out
Hе thinking bout the killing, he know how to
And you ain't gotta be no quarter back to see just what he going through

He don't fuck wit niggas
And that shit crazy cause mom dukes ain't even fuckin wit em

Soon he hit the door they on his ass like some pants on em
Guns on em, stripped him butt naked, it ain't nun on em
Lil bro took gloves and his mask off ain't nun em
Flip the script and put the gun on his manz he tried to run from em
Hit his manz inna back, his manz drop he took the gun from em

Fat ass, tummy flat

Put her on a flight, leave her in the Dot
Stir Fry cookin' pot
Flair down her ass, that pussy fire
We may pull up with that desire
Money bag, I admire
Success in life, I aspire
Thinking back, I wasn't hired
Can't break my heart, Heart of a Lion
Don't fuck with us, you may go dying
Read you back like I'ma go prying
Catch me rollin'
I'm controlling
Steam hot boilin'
Your heart be broken, uh
I got a mothefuckin' Glock in my hand, bruh
When you around it come with a murder
Surprising nobody like a Master
I'm on High', can't go faster
Control your heart like controlla
Top so high like stoner
Ranging off like a Rover
Taking off like ''Grr graahh''"
Pusha T,The Story of Adidon by Pusha T,"[Intro]
Easy money
It's about to be a surgical summer
Chop the tops off the coupes
The cuatrociento' ochenta y ocho
The Spider joint
And you know we gotta cut the heads off these snakes, right?
Watch the body drop
[Verse]
Drug dealin' aside, ghostwritin' aside
Let's have a heart-to-heart about your pride
Even though you're multi, I see that your soul don't look alive
The M's count different when Baby divides the pie, wait
Let's examine why
Your music for the past few years been angry and full of lies
I'll start it at the home front, ""I'm On One""
Dennis Graham stay off the 'Gram, bitch, I'm on one
You mention wedding ring like it's a bad thing
Your father walked away at five—hell of a dad thing
Marriage is somethin' that Sandi never had, Drake
How you a winner but she keep comin' in last place?
Monkey-suit Dennis, you parade him
A Steve Harvey-suit nigga made him
Confused, always felt you weren't Black enough
Afraid to grow it 'cause your 'fro wouldn't nap enough
Since you name-dropped my fiancée
Let 'em know who you chose as your Beyoncé
Sophie knows better as your baby mother
Cleaned her up for IG, but the stench is on her
A baby's involved, it's deeper than rap
We talkin' character, let me keep with the facts
You are hiding a child, let that boy come home
Deadbeat mothafucka playin' border patrol, ooh
Adonis is your son
And he deserves more than an Adidas press run; that's real
Love that baby, respect that girl
Forget she's a pornstar, let her be your world, yuugh!
How dare you put Ye in my verses?
I'm selfish, I want all of the curses
I'm pre-bookin' the churches, me versus three hearses
If we all go to Hell, it'll be worth it
Already aligned with the greats, and on that same note
The only ones I chase are two ghosts
Still givin' you classics, that's the only thing that dates me
OVO 40, hunched over like he 80—tick, tick, tick
How much time he got? That man is sick, sick, sick
I got the devil flow, nigga—six-six-six
Surgical summer with it—snip, snip, snip
And you don't really want it with him
[Outro]
Surgical Summer, Volume 1
We gon' take this slow
We just gon' peel it back layer-by-layer
Yeah, DAYTONA
Album of the motherfuckin' year
And you talkin' 'bout you upset
Hahahahaha
Well, I wanna see what it's like when you get angry, okay?
You show me that

I believe there's a God above me
I'm just the god of everything else
I put holes in everything else
""New God Flow,"" fuck everything else
Supreme dope dealer,
write it in bold letters
They love a nigga's spirit like Pac at the Coachella
They said Push ain't fit with the umbrella
But I was good with the yay' as a wholesaler
I think it's good that 'Ye got a blow dealer
A hot temper matched with a cold killer
I came aboard for more than just to rhyme with him
Think '99, when Puff woulda had Shyne with him (Yuugh)
Matchin' Daytonas, rose gold on us
Goin' HAM in Ibiza done took a toll on us
But since you overdo it, I'ma pour more
Well if you goin' coupe, I'm goin' four door

But the Yeezys jumped over the Jumpman
Went from most hated to the champion god flow
I guess that's a feeling only me and LeBron know
I'm living three dreams
Biggie Smalls', Dr. King, Rodney King's, uh
'Cause we can't get along, no resolution
'Til we drown all these haters, rest in peace to Whitney Houston
Cars, money, girls and the clothes
Aw, man, you sold your soul
Nah, man, mad people was frontin'
Aw, man, made somethin' from nothin'
Picture workin' so hard and you can't cut through
That can mess up your whole life, like an uncle that touched you
What has the world come to? I'm from the 3-1-2
Where cops don't come through and dreams don't come true
Like there the God go, in his Murcielago
From workin' McDonalds, barely payin' the car note
He even got enough to get his mama a condo
Then they ran up and shot him, right in front of his mom
Forty killings in a weekend, forty killings in a week
Man, the summer too hot, you can feel it in the street
Welcome to Sunday service, if you hope to someday serve us
We got green in our eyes, just follow my Erick Sermon
Did Moses not part the water with the cane?
Did strippers not make an ark when I made it rain?
Did Yeezy not get signed by Hov and Dame?
And ran to Jacob and made the new Jesus chains?
In Jesus' name, let the choir say
""I'm on fire, ayy,"" that's what Richard Pryor say
And we'll annihilate anybody that violate
Ask any dope boy you know, they admire 'Ye[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]

Six hundred Cuban cigar in the big tub
Medallion on, Dove soap on the fresh cut
With soap suds on the MAC-11
My big lion haven't ate since twelve and it's after seven
We feed the nigga like forty chickens
His tail wag when I send him a bag with just one victim
Uh-huh, now let me show you what my closet on
Gems in the display case, call it a rock-a-thon
I— I got soccer moms payin' for cock
Asians get it from behind while they cleanin' they wok
Comin' with flows that is toxic (Come on)
Deadly fumes when I'm in the room
Repercussions occur when you dry snitch
Red light, green light, one, two, three
Look mean, got my machine, cried and hit you, please
Said and shake that body, scar up that body
Should I kill him now Tone?
I said, ""Probably""
Side bets are four and better
Bust hammers with pot holders
And yo, dead a cow for his fuckin' leather
I'm not bow-legged, but old school like Redd Foxx
My favorite color in my hustle days was red tops
My gold eagle arm shitted out a red rock
Threw it off my project roof and saw red dots
Kanye, shine a light on my Wallabees
You can have a good time with G-O-D

W-W-W-What is it?
[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Twenty-plus years of selling Johnson & Johnson
I started out as a baby-faced monster
No wonder there's diaper rash on my conscience
My teething ring was numbed by the nonsense
Gem Star razor and a dinner plate
Arm & Hammer and a Mason jar, that's my dinner date
Then crack the window in the kitchen, let it ventilate
'Cause I let it sizzle on the stove like a Minute Steak
Nigga, I was crack in the school zone
Two beepers on me, Starter jacket that was two-toned
Four lockers, four different bitches got their mule on
Black Ferris Bueller, cutting school with his jewels on
Couldn't do wrong with a chest full of chains and a arm full of watches
What I sell for pain in the hood, I'm a doctor
Zhivago, tried to fight the urge
Like Ivan Drago, ""If he dies, he dies""
Like Doughboy to Tre, if he rides, he rides
Throwing punches in his room, if he cries, he cries
We don't drink away the pain when a nigga die
We add a link to the chain, inscribe a nigga name in your flesh
We playin' on a higher game of chess
Once you delegate his bills, who gon' fuck his bitch the best?
A million megapixels of the Pyrex
Started on the scale, digital, my only Timex
Nigga, this is timeless, simply 'cause it's honest
Pure as the fumes that be fuckin' with my sinus
Nigga, this is Simon Says, Simon Red
Blood on your diamonds 'til you dying – dead,
yuugh!

You wanna see a dead body?
Instrumentals from my momma's Christmas party
Trouble's on my mind
I still smell crime,
my little brother crying
Smokers repeatedly buying my Sega Genesis
Either that or my auntie was stealing it
Hit the pipe and start feeling it
Ooh, wee, cut me some slack, weed never did that
This was different, geez, Louise, please help me relax
Quantum physics could never show you the world I was in
When I was ten, back when nine ounces had got you ten
And nine times out of ten, niggas don't pay attention
And when it's tension in the air, nines come with extensions
My daddy turned a quarter-piece to a four and a half
Took a L, started selling soap fiends bubble bath
Broke his nails misusing his pinky to treat his nose
Shirt buttoned open,
taco meat laying on his gold
I said, ""Daddy, one day, I'ma get you right with thirty-six zips
One thousand  grams of cocaine, then your name will be rich
Now you can rock it up or sell it soft as leather interior
Drop some ice cubes in it, Deebo on perimeter""
He said, ""Son, how come you think you be my connect?""
I said, ""Pops, your ass is washed up, with all due respect""
He said, ""Well, nigga, then show me how it all makes sense""
Go figure, motherfucker, every verse is a brick
Your son dope, nigga!
Now reap what you sowed, nigga! (Please reap what you sowed, nigga)
I was born in '87, my granddaddy a legend
Now the same shit that y'all was smoking is my profession

The bigger question is how the Russians did it
It was written like Nas, but it came from Quentin
At the mercy of a game where the codes is missin'
When the CEO's blinded by the glow it's different
Believe in myself and the Coles and Kendricks
Let the sock puppets play in their roles and gimmicks
Shit, remember Will Smith won the first Grammy?
And they ain't even recognize Hov until ""Annie""
So I don't tap dance for the crackers and sing Mammy
'Cause I'm ’posed to juggle these flows and nose candy (yugh)

They be ridin' these waves, I pulled my sandals out
Jefe Latin my Grammy, I went the Spanish route
Oh, now it’s okay to kill Baby?

Salute Ross 'cause the message was pure

Flash without the fire

Shit, I’ve been exposed, I took the crack and built the wire
Now who do you admire?

Poop, scoop!
Whoop! Whoopty-whoop!
Am I too complex for ComplexCon?
Everything Ye say cause a new debate
""You see, he been out of touch, he cannot relate
His hallway too long, bitch too bad
Got a surrogate, his kid get two dads""
I be thinkin', ""What would 2Pac do?""
You be thinkin' what New Kids on the Block do
If you ain't drivin' while Black, do they stop you?
Will MAGA hats let me slide like a drive-thru?
That phone call from Ricky still hazy
When heaven got an angel named Avery
You gotta watch who you callin' crazy
Yeezy, the newest billion-dollar baby
It won't feel right 'til I feel like Phil Knight
Goin' for six rings like what Phil told Mike
Seven pill nights, who know what that feel like?
No more hidin' the scars, I show 'em like Seal, right?
How do you respond?"

How you feelin'? (Fine!)
You feel alright?

I'm so bossy, bitch, get off me (Yeah!)
It's a different jingle when you hear these car keys (Y'all feel like danc—)
Your SL's missin' a S, nigga (Y'all feel like danc—)
Your plane's missin' a chef
The common theme, see, they both got wings
If you fly, do it to death
It's only one God, and it's only one crown
So it's only one king that can stand on this mound (Yeah!)
King Push, kingpin, overlord
Coast Guard come, a hundred goin' overboard (Yeah!)
I got money with the best of 'em
Go blow-for-blow with any Mexican
Don't let your side bitches settle in
Might have to headbutt you, Evelyn
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
Hard to get a handle on this double-edged sword
Whether rappin' or I'm rappin' to a whore
Might reach back and relapse to wrappin' up this raw (Y'all feel like danc—)
Givenchy fittin' like it's gym clothes
We really gym stars, I'm like D. Rose
No D-League, I'm like this close

Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards

Motherfuckers can't rhyme no more, 'bout crime no more
Mix drug and show money, ""Biggs"" Burke on tour  (Yeah!)
Twenty-five bricks, move work like chore
Hit Delaware twice, needed twenty-five more
I see flaw, cracks in your diamond
CB4
when you rhyme, Simple Simon
Come and meet the pieman,
a must that I flaunt it
The legend grows legs when it comes back to haunt us
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards (Yeah!)
Can't a bitch livin' say I bought her Michael Kors (Yeah!)
Every car driven was decided by the horse
Keep the sticker in the window 'case you wonder what it cost
How could you relate when you ain't never been great?
And rely on rap money to keep food up on your plates, nigga?
I might sell a brick on my birthday
Thirty-six years of doin' dirt like it's Earth Day—God!

Valentino summers and wave runners
Chains on my niggas like slave runners
Drug dealers anonymous
How many Madonnas can that Mazda fit?
My brick talk is more than obvious, it’s ominous
Garages, the phantom, ghouls, ghosts and goblins
Blonde mohawk the collection I’m Dennis Rodman
The money count is the only moment of silence
Cause hush money balances all this drugs and violence
Hat trick under my mattress
Date I stop still has an asterisk after it
After all I can make a call
I can baptize a brick
As I wash away my sins like a catholic
Who the fuck ain't mastered this
America’s nightmare's in Flint
Children of a lesser God when your melanin’s got a tint
And I can’t even mention what I sent or what I spent
'Cause my name in 18 wheelers is evidence
I put my boos in those cruise collections
Life’s a bitch
A to Z on her shoe collection, take your pick
Paid in full like ’86, Gs on my body
The new Gucci has less monograms, God’s got him
Let he without sin cast the first stone
So I built that all glass quad level first home
Shatter all of your misconceptions
Hold all of them missing weapons
You thought I would miss my blessing
The ultimate misdirection ya

IRS should’ve had the townhouses surrounded
Thanks to the lawyers
I marbled the foyer

Yeah, that’s for the Koi fish
We been dining on oysters
I walk though the garage it’s like multiple choices
I told ‘em pull the Royce up
I’m getting ghost, I’m hearing noises
I think it’s the boys, but I been banking at Deutsche
We got storefronts, we got employee stubs
We been opening studios and 40/40s up
The paper trail is gorgeous
Cases we buries ‘em
Before Reasonable Doubt dropped, the jury hung
Bling bling
Every time I come around your city bling bling
My tenure took me through Virginia
Ask Teddy Riley ‘bout me
Ask the Federalis ‘bout me
Tried to build a cell around me
Snatched my nigga Emory up
Tried to get him to tell about me
He told 12, “Gimme 12”
He told them to go to hell about me

Y’all think Uber’s the future, our cars been autonomous
Mules move the drums, take ‘em to different spots

Therein lies the piece of God
I always knew I was a prophet, but I couldn’t find a decent job

So that weapon on me
Bitch, I can't go and I'll be damned if I let a nigga come step on me
My niggas gon' step for me
If it end up bein' my time, I know I'ma rest in peace, mmm
[Chorus]
As I ride through my city
I been feelin' like somebody tryna get me
So that weapon on me
Bitch, I can't go and I'll be damned if I let a nigga come step on me
My niggas gon' step for me
So if it end up bein' my time, then I know I'ma rest in peace
Streets gon' be the death of me
I'ma die shootin' this blick 'til it's nothin' else left in it
[Verse 1]
Until death calls my name
I'ma forever be thuggin', forever goin' hard for the gang
Remember that feeling when I was covered in them chains
Nobody was with me, now it's feeling like can't nobody get me
I was a lost child, pure heart
Let anybody get to close to me, just do what they want
Soul empty, blackhearted, I feel my spirit crying
Smile, but I'm unhappy, you might think I'm lying
Pushin' my whip through the city, bitch, I been bendin' traffic
Won't catch me at that red light, no, I won't let it happen
Mmm, no, I won't let it happen
[Chorus]
As I ride through my city
I been feelin' like somebody tryna get me
So that weapon on me
Bitch, I can't go and I'll be damned if I let a nigga come step on me
My niggas gon' step for me
So if it end up bein' my time, then I know I'ma rest in peace
Streets gon' be the death of me
I'ma die shootin' this blick 'til it's nothin' else left in it
[Verse 2]
Stuck in these trenches, tryna make it out
Feel like the devil out to get me and the opps been tryna take me out
Can't let 'em take me out, so I ride with this bitch next to me
They get one up and I'm dyin' with this bitch next to me
'Cause I refuse to let up
The day they catch me and they paint a nigga red, know I was set up
Told my big brother keep his head up
Don't let them crackers keep you down for long, my nigga, you gotta just get up
'Cause shit gon' get better
Can't trust a soul 'cause everybody changed on him like the weather, mmm
Can't trust a soul 'cause everybody changed on him like the weather[Chorus]
As I ride through my city
I been feelin' like somebody tryna get me
So that weapon on me
Bitch, I can't go and I'll be damned if I let a nigga come step on me
My niggas gon' step for me
So if it end up bein' my time, then I know I'ma rest in peace
Streets gon' be the death of me
I'ma die shootin' this blick 'til it's nothin' else left in it"

Time go by, niggas change so much
Why the fuck these niggas looking at my chain so much?
They just mad 'cause I departed from the game so much
One false move and the gang gon' bust

Cartier glasses, 20/20, got a clear view

Act up, we gon' mask up, boy, I dare you
Brody catch a body, I'ma leave you in the rearview
Could have did it to me, lil' nigga, you were scared to (Skrrt, skrrt)
You a bluff and you not who you appear to
You'd be starstruck if you see a nigga near you
And your bitch wanna fuck, I don't care to
Careful, if I say links, plan's canceled
I can have your shorty in my bed doing dance moves
Fuck that, let's get right back to the real shit
In the field shit, niggas really used to drill shit
Mama stressed out, whole lot she gotta deal with
Swear every real nigga gon' feel this
Smokin' on drugs 'cause there's too much to deal with
SB strapped up in the field with it[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
My mama know about the pain, thought I'd never change
But looking back, for the fame, I felt the same
I was stuck up in the streets, but I had a brain
I ain't have no money, we was looking for a nigga chain
Listen, all I ever wanted was to have a name
Had a lot of shit to lose, not enough to gain
And that fuck nigga changed, went against the grain
Found out my homie went fed, almost went insane
Strictly business, you ain't with it, you get parked, nigga
I don't know you, you wasn't with me from the start, nigga
I remember catching stains in the park, nigga
Me and Bubba tryna catch an opp after dark, nigga
My mama told me, ""Wisen up, be a smart nigga""
So all my niggas on go like a kart, nigga
Smelly drive mean a bullet to your heart, nigga
I don't really wanna speak facts, see the chart, nigga[Refrain]
Grrr, pow, I'ma skip town, see my wrist drown

So I'm skrrting off the scene in a foreign, see me goin' (Ooh)
Me and YG up in Cali smoking GT out the bong (Oh)
Shawty pulled up in a thong, I don't know what she on
If she ask to spend the night then I might give her what she want
(Dystinkt Beats)
[Verse 1]
Everything is going Gucci, see me Lou V
I can't let a nigga shoot me, I'm in a two seat
And before I speak about it, rather grab a loose leaf
Thirty clip of the dip, and I'm in a hoopty
And we spin the opp block with a mini Uzi
Had to send a couple shots, I been acting bougie
All the sudden all these thots let me in they coochie
They gon' make they pussy pop tryna get my blue cheese
Low-key I be in the streets tryna OD
Low-key 'cause the industry, I'm not the old me
Low-key started peeping niggas not my homies
Phony nigga ate that shit like macaroni
And I remember last year niggas went to Coney
Never thought that this year I'd have a deal with Sony
Lil TJay SB, I'm the one and only
And I just came home and everybody know me
If you want another
G.O.A.T
., guess you gotta clone me
Quit talkin' 'bout some loyalty you never showed me
Nigga, I don't owe you like you never owed me
Once I got a little clout, everybody know me
And we never had to prove this, we really do this
You was never in the field, you was on your school shit
Now my energy is boosted, my mind exuded
They gon' make a nigga lose it, they acting stupid
I got up out my Birkin, it's workin'
She said she a virgin, it's hurtin'
But she ain't never show me love when my pockets hurtin'
Now she see a nigga on, she fucking and slurping
And they see me puttin' on and it got them nervous
We don't never need to ball, I did it on purpose
And I used to play the block with the fiends, got some knots in my jeans
If a nigga talk hot, we gon' pop for his bean
(Nah-nah)
I'm coming strong and they knew that
You ain't no competition, boy, don't think you wanna do that (I'm like)
You had your chance, but you blew that (Lil Tjay)
Everybody asking who that? (Oh, no, no, no, no)
The fuck going on?
Someone in my circle started leaking all my songs
I'ma stay ten toes, I'ma still go strong
I don't get these snake niggas, we just can't get along
[Chorus]
So I'm skrrting off the scene in a foreign, see me goin'
Me and YG up in Cali smoking GT out the bong
Shawty pulled up in a thong
, I don't know what she on
If she ask to spend the night then I might give her what she want
Fuck her one time, maybe two times if she too fine
Make your boo mine, I'm in the stu', this my new grind
I'm cooking up, I'm cooking up, ain't tryna lose time
I shoot it up, don't give a fuck, ain't tryna lose mine
[Verse 2]
Gangbang, growing up I was Stain Gang
Stain Gang, promise I was only tryna maintain
Lil TJay SB, that's the gang gang
Ask about me, bet they tell you how my name ring
And I know they gon' hate 'cause I'm up now
I'm at the point where I don't really give a fuck now
Free the guys, I'ma say it 'til they touch down
One day everybody have a bustdown

Had too much respect for her mother
Ain't wanna lay hands on her brother
Flexin', she all on my

Told her I ain't tryna fuck now

Said if I was a book she would read it
I'm tryna come up with my mans though
Ain't got no time for no damn ho
I kill it and leave it like Rambo
I play bitches like the piano
This money keep comin', got handfuls
And niggas be hatin', they fans though
I bug out on all instrumentals
It might be my time, but I can't go
So plenty of bitches got ran through
I'm just that nigga, it's simple
I love all the clout and attention
That's why I'ma cop me a mansion
This hustle don't come with a pension
I'm workin' on shit I ain't mentioned
I'm workin' on shit I ain't mentioned
We workin' on shit I ain't mentioned
(Mention)[Chorus]
Put TYB on my resume (Yeah)
Keep it real, boy, don't interrogate (Nah)
I fucked your bitch, I ain't hesitate (Nah)
Put TYB on my resume
She was a average bitch anyway
I left her then moved on to better things
She was an average bitch anyway
I left her then moved on to better things
[Verse 3]
Down for my niggas, don't come in between
Yeah, that's your bitch, but she comin' with me
She like my 'fro so she fuck with my team
She like the print that she see in my jeans
She said, ""I'm different,"" I'm like, ""What you mean?""
Shorty keep callin', I'm lettin' it ring
All she gon' say is, ""I'm doin' my thing""
Gotta start somewhere, I'm chasin' my dream
Started off hungry like Jack and the Bean
Hurt me to say that I'm drug to the fiends
I'ma get money, that's by any means
Not worried 'bout niggas that's worried 'bout me
Yeah, I'm from Ryer and 183
Used to be deep now it's nobody free
Do it for Smelly, I do it for E
Bitches on me and I don't give a fuck
Sometimes I feel like it's all about us
Free all my niggas, I'm turnin' shit up
Codeine with the Sprite, ain't no ice in my cup
Yo' bitch finessin' my dick like a dutch
TYB Season, I'm home and it's here
I take yo bitch anytime of the year
'Bout to take off and I'm switchin' my gear
Only 16 and I'm on my way there
Niggas be hatin', I really don't care
Niggas be hatin', I really don't care
I really don't care
(I really don't care, I really don't care)[Chorus]
Put TYB on my resume (Yeah)
Keep it real, boy, don't interrogate (Nah)
I fucked your bitch, I ain't hesitate (Nah)
Put TYB on my resume
She was a average bitch anyway
I left her then moved on to better things
She was an average bitch anyway
I left her then moved on to better things
[Outro]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Got up out my Birkin, It's workin'
She said she a virgin, it's hurtin'
She my biggest fan, she always lurkin'
And she know I'm a man, I'ma put that work in
And I know she can't stand me, I'm fancy
So I'ma bring her out when I get my Grammy
Late night sex, she can't find her panties
I couldn't hold it in, now she need a Plan B
His bitch need a Plan B

I swear you ride it so good (So good)
That pussy blow me away
And I been thinkin' 'bout your smile
All mornin' for a while
'Bout the way you twist your face while I'm strokin' in and out
Girl, you shocked me, I'm so wowed
Got me slippin', I'm like, ""How?""
First I met you on the 'Gram, I picked you up and took you out
Let me show you what I'm 'bout
Let them haters run they mouth
You should know you somethin' different 'cause I brought you to my house
Serve you breakfast on my couch
Anything you ever need, you know I'll be there with no doubt
I need you by my side, I hope you're here to ride
I hate to see you hurtin', my lil' baby, wipe your eyes
[Chorus]
Baby, let me pull your dress down (Dress down)
Kiss you from your neck down (Neck down)

Baby, just let me pull your dress down
Kiss you from your neck down
Have you screaming ""Oh,"" them sex sounds
[Verse 2]
Baby, I need you in my life, it's like there's no one there
Nobody, can I turn to you next time there's no one there?
I need a girl to match my loyalty when times get rough
I turn to you 'cause I know damn well you don't give a fuck
About them, let them niggas hate
Either way, regardless what they saying, we'll be great
Let's go explore the whole world, fuck the skippin' states
You got me feelin' different, I might let it go today
[Pre-Chorus]
Mm-mm-mm, might let it go
Oh, oh, oh, might let it go

Lil Tjay,20/20 by Lil Tjay,"[Verse 1]
I feel like the greatest
Only been at this for two years, thank God this shit happened so quick
Fashion me the latest, money comin' in but so do hatred
Shit ain't how I pictured, but I faced it
Emotions, I erased it, fuck havin' feelings, I replaced it
Should've peeped that fu' shit from the basis
This when the mistakes hit, tired of gettin' caught up in this fake shit
I just can't sit comfy with no snake shit
[Refrain]
I been holdin' demons inside, I can't lie
So if you ain't ready to die, then don't try
I gotta make it home so my mama don't cry
I'd rather do the sentence, least time'll go by
Feel the pain, so numb, I don't feel nothin'
Shooters still runnin' 'round with no chill button
Still be totin' in the town, finna drill somethin'
Let a nigga run up on me thinkin' I won't kill somethin'
[Verse 2]
And I keep the gang with me, try it, bet we air shit
Everybody get it, if it's static, we don't spare shit
Really on my bully, 2020, we ain't playin'
Now it's lit for everything, don't care 'bout what you sayin'
Mama, she was prayin', I was on that block late
Really put in twenty years of work, but then I got weight
Sunday I ain't never go to church because that block pay
Big .40 cal' in my shirt, no karate
Fuck what the opps say, fuck what the cops say
Big Smelly drive, E for E, that's the block way
If you feel a way, grrt-baow what the Glock say
All my niggas tryna get the bag, fuck the pop way
[Chorus]
I just want my name to be around when I ain't here
Livin' in the moment, but I want this shit for years
They like, ""Tjay, bro, you made it,"" I still feel like I ain't there
A lot of niggas hated, I said, ""Fuck it, I don't care,"" 'cause I'm takin' off
I'ma soon be the greatest, takin' off
I'ma soon be the greatest, takin' off
I'ma soon be the greatest, huh
I'ma soon be the greatest
[Verse 3]
Words that they did not say, dick suckin' crazy
Everybody tryna beach for clout like it's wavy
Guess I'm just too real, I stood solid, how they made me
I can never be a goofy nigga if they paid me
Songs too heat now, everything is wavy
Lot of niggas think it's competition, they amaze me
I was goin' downhill, jail kinda saved me
Gotta keep the hard work, ain't no gettin' lazy
Smokin' opposition kinda sorta got me dazy
Think you'd last a day up in my shoes, then nigga, trade me
Bitch, I need a billion in blues like I'm JAY-Z
Huh, R.I.P. to Mavy
Bitch, I'm cookin' now, got the sauce like it's gravy
If you want a feature, get your money right and pay me
Still, when the time come, it might be a maybe
It depend on the type of record that you gon' play me
I can't do a wack verse, industry would trade me
Every time you hear my name, you know I'm goin' crazy
Really, I'm a trench kid, SB really made me
Really had the same goal and dream since a baby, ooh-ooh-ooh[Chorus]
I just want my name to be around when I ain't here
Livin' in the moment, but I want this shit for years
They like, ""Tjay, bro, you made it,"" I still feel like I ain't there
A lot of niggas hated, I said, ""Fuck it, I don't care,"" 'cause I'm takin' off

Know the feds watchin', middle fingers to the government
Glock in this Louis pouch, nigga, I ain't tusslin'
Catfish, he don't really know who he fuckin' with
Opps send a message, you grab a Drac' to rebuttal it
Had a undertaker at your tombstone, shovelin'
Hell yeah, hollows bound to chew 'em like some Doublemint
Made it out the field with somе niggas I was thuggin' with
We'll send some shots through thеy crowd while they huddlin'
I'm the type to leave it in the streets, I ain't discussin' it
Tryna make it flip, I need that Rolls-Royce Cullinan
Old bitches trippin', cut her off like a Backwood
Middle of the trenches, that's where me and the guys stood

Hundred thousand 'round my neck for the chain
Tryna go out like a vet' in the game, put respect on my name
No security, I'm flexin' with gang, I'm a real one
Reminiscin' about all of my decisions
Embracin' the way of livin', I was runnin' through the field, dumb
Couple niggas disrespectin', we done killed them
Keep a shooter, they won't see, he my lil' one
Thirty shots, we ain't into usin' lil' guns
Nigga talkin' like he know me, he my real son
Rap beef, fuck the cap, I'ma drill some
Put the glizzy to your melon, make you feel dumb

How you screamin', ""Day one,"" doin' fake shit?

Remember selling nicks right on the boulevard
Going downtown, tryna steal a nigga car
And if I call Tut he'll pull a nigga card

Free all my day one niggas out the slammer
Opp nigga told, black and white, he a panda
Got me finna run up in his crib like I'm Santa

Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? (Yeah)
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop
[Verse 1: DaBaby]
It's safe to say I earned it, ain't a nigga gave me nothin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm ready to hop out on a nigga, get to bustin'
Know you heard me say, ""You play, you lay,"" don't make me push the button
Full of pain, dropped enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket
Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
I got a big drum, it hold a hundred, ain't goin' for nothin'
I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
Just talked to my mama, she hit me on FaceTime just to check up on me and my brother
I'm really the baby, she know that her youngest son was always guaranteed to get the money (Okay, let's go)
She know that her baby boy was always guaranteed to get the loot
She know what I do, she know 'fore I run from a nigga, I'ma pull it out and shoot (Boom)
PTSD, I'm always waking up in cold sweats like I got the flu
My daughter a G, she saw me kill a nigga in front of her before the age of two
And I'll kill another nigga too
'Fore I let another nigga do somethin' to you
Long as you know that, don't let nobody tell you different
Daddy love you (Yeah, yeah)

Keep a Glocky when I ride in the Suburban
'Cause the codeine had a young nigga swervin'
I got the mop, watch me wash 'em like detergent
And I'm ballin', that's why it's diamonds on my jersey
Slide on opps' side and flip the block back, yeah, yeah
My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
Fool me one time, you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin
Maybach SUV for my refugees
Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day
But they ain't even want no smoke
If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote

Wheezy outta here
[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Yeah, rest in peace to Bankroll‚ show 'em how to do it
Baby goin' crazy‚ he been gettin' straight to it
I done caught so many flights I end up fuckin' all the stewardesses
Catch me in Atlanta‚ no security with my jewelry
Found I was rich, my baby mama talkin' suin' me
'Nother bitch tellin' lies on the pussy like she screwin' me
Catch him down bad, that's his ass‚ nigga, you or me
SI diamonds on the chain, he ain't foolin' me
We was skippin' school on the train‚ duckin' truancy
My main partner turned into a rat, he talkin' 'bout robbin' me
I pray the judge give that boy a bond so I can pop him
We was in the hood, sellin' bags, shootin' choppers
Fucked around and tried to go and lease a helicopter
Baby really a problem, somebody gotta stop him
And the haters watchin' too hard, I think they got binoculars
Every nigga with me on go, it ain't no stoppin' us
Niggas actin' like they got the bag, I'm tryna stop it up
Do this for the bros down the road, gotta lock it up
All you gotta do is say it's smoke, then we're poppin' up
Baby got the streets on hold, he ain't drop yet
I've been goin' hard, it's gon' be hard for you to top that
I make it look easy, but this shit really a process
I'm really a millionaire, still in the projects
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Baby puttin' on for the city
Baby, he the realest, Baby prolly got a couple million
Baby hang with four or five killers
Baby got children, Baby prolly still drug dealin
Baby ain't a trapper, he a rapper
Baby makin' classics, Baby in the hood gettin' active
Baby keep it real with his people
Baby like a preacher,
Baby prolly still sell reefer

Huh? Baby prolly still got them
'bows
I tell my bitch I'm faithful, but I still got the hoes
Baby gettin' jiggy,
on stage with the Glizzy
Baby CEO, he shake the game like he Diddy
You would think it's Mardi Gras, I got these bitches showin' titties
And I ain't throwin' beads, I pull them bitches' weaves
I'm stallin' bitches out, if I'm a dog, then she a flea
And when I fuck her doggystyle the only time I'm on my knee
I barely wanna hit her, got her beggin', ""Baby, please""
I tell a bitch to shut up, you 'bout to fuck my nut up
The label's CEO keep beggin' me to keep the gun up
They know, you play with Baby, Baby beat him, cut up
Private plane, Wi-Fi, on the FaceTime with Johnny
I told him ice my wrist up, I like to hold my fist up
How that boy DaBaby in the air not gettin' his dick sucked?
Why he keep the fire and throw them fours in every picture?
'Cause nigga...[Chorus: Lil Baby]

Thinkin' 'bout my grandmama and shit
(Wait a minute, who are you?)
I got the number one record, they acknowledged the jit
(Ayy, yo, Kid)
They goin' crazy when they play it, head bobbin' and shit
And I'm just somewhere fucked up thinkin' 'bout my father and shit
They found him dead a couple days before I started tour
Same day I flew back to the city from Miami
I was out there with the family
Just lookin' at my daughter
Thinkin' to myself like, ""Damn, my baby look just like my daddy""
Same time I got the news, my shit went number one, that's fucked up
That shit there was confusin', a lil' bit, you know I flew in with the stick
Okay, like let me know what's up before I lose it in this bitch
And everybody tryna talk, I ain't tryna talk, I'm tryna click
I'm tryna send somebody wit' him
Somebody let me know what's happenin'
My last name K-I-R-K, Kirk
You know how I rock behind my daddy
You know I never gave a fuck about the world, just about my family
How the fuck I make it to the top same day I lost the nigga that had me?
How a nigga perform on BET and a year ago couldn't afford a sandwich?
I had to move in with TG when I went broke movin' out to Cali
What you know about smilin' every day for all your fans, actin' like you happy?
I spent a hundred thousand layin' my daddy to rest, but I ain't braggin'
I got some questions, I'm a die about respect if I don't get answers
My mama stood up in that chair, took it like a G when she had cancer
My brother be thinkin' that we don't love him and let him struggle like we ain't family
Like I won't give up all I got to see you happy, nigga
We shocked the world, everybody know what's happenin', nigga
I'm still Lil' Jon Jon, my song, it just went platinum, nigga
We on our own time, let's go move out to Cali, nigga
Put the kids in homeschool, let's go get us a mansion, nigga
Let's raise our kids right, let's watch the shit we teach 'em, nigga
Let's start a business for you so they can't say that you leechin', nigga
How I know I'm the chosen one, 'cause sometimes when I be speakin', nigga

If I love you, then I need ya (Let's go)
I fuck with you like Martin fuck with Gina (Uh)
We family like we Venus and Serena (Hey)
Let's go get married like we Thankgod and Kenisha (Okay)
Don't give a fuck about the world, just 'bout my people (Facts)

Niggas ain't cut from the same cloth, these niggas see-through (Ayy)
And I be too busy doin' me to see what he do, nigga
[Verse 2]
Yeah, verse two, that lil' nigga from the other side (Uh-huh)
And I do it myself, whenever I ride, you know that my brothers ride (Okay)
And I still got a lotta shit on my mind that I can't undecide (Yeah, yeah)
Got me ready to slide, feelin' like Doughboy when his brother died (Boyz n the Hood)
You know how I step, you know how I rep, you know about Baby, nigga (You know about Baby)
You know how I'm comin' back for that cross if you ever play me, nigga (Get back)
You know how I got it up out the mud and turned it to gravy, nigga (Huh)

Run that back, Turbo
[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
You can get the biggest Chanel bag in the store if you want it
I gave 'em the drip, they sucked it up, I got 'em moanin'
I bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned 'em
Takin' these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the mornin'
That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it
If I'm in the club, I got that fire when I'm performin'
The backend just came in, in all hundreds
Vibes galore, cute shit, they all on us
I'm from Atlanta where young niggas run shit
I know they hatin' on me, but I don't read comments
Whenever I tell her to come, she comin'
Whenever it's smoke, we ain't runnin'
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Yeah, every other night, another dollar gettin' made
Every other night started with a good day
I feel like a child, I got boogers in the face
Diamonds dancin' in the dial like this shit is a parade
I don't want your chain, Young GonWunna not a slave
I had to draw the line, too many bitches gettin' saved
TSA harass me, so I took a private plane
These pussy niggas lackin', why I'm workin' on my aim
Drip too hard (Too hard), charge it to the card (To the card)
Designer to the ground, I can barely spell the names
Drip too hard, caution on the floor
You gon' fuck around and drown tryna ride a nigga wave[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave

Gunna,Sold Out Dates by Gunna (Ft. Lil Baby),"[Intro: Gunna]
Yeah, yeah
Young, young, young Gunna, yeah
Run that back, Turbo
Baby
[Chorus: Gunna]
Sold-out dates, cash every day
I got you Hermés, I light up Blu-rays
This cheetah my pet, the condo a cage
Addicted to sex, I gotta get laid
My jacket Off-White, don't mean that it's beige
I clean up real nice, I don't got a maid
An ape in the night, I'm still rockin' Bape
Live on paradise, I don't see the shade
[Verse 1: Gunna]
'Nother backend, I'm back on the road
Flooded Patek, paid off a show
Drippin' is rare, more this Vlone
Hoes by the pair, I'm never alone
Sleep on the Lear, Comme des Garçons
Drop eight in a two and let it dissolve
Balmain my denim, young GunWunna ball
Rock the whole concert and hopped in a frog
My foreign's a toy, I'm still a kid
10K this year for Coachella, it's lit
Rolls got umbrellas to cover her wig
Open Ceremony, left them in a trench
Lightning bolt diamonds 'cause I want revenge
We straight like a line, man, I really got rich
Some more fancy yellow diamonds in my piss
Don't get it confused, I'm still bangin' the six
New Cartier, Gunna a don
Niggas tryna soak up the drip like a sponge
Hatred's contagious, I keep me a gun
I'm focused on makin' a M in a month
Baby order twenty thousand in ones
Walk in and buy, I'm not asking how much
Red on the bottom, you need to catch up
Consistently droppin', I need me a dub[Chorus: Gunna]
Sold-out dates, cash every day
I got you Hermés, I light up Blu-rays
This cheetah my pet, the condo a cage
Addicted to sex, I gotta get laid
My jacket Off-White, don't mean that it's beige
I clean up real nice, I don't got a maid
An ape in the night, I'm still rockin' Bape
Live on paradise, I don't see the shade
[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Me and young Gunna back at it again
We just left New York, double datin' with twins
I just bought a Wraith, I retired the Benz
I fired my bitch and I hired her friend
I see all the hate through these Cartier lens
Every two months tryna put up an M
My dog caught a body, they got it on film
He still rockin' Gucci watches in the pen
Take a trip 'round the globe then we do it again
Got 'em watchin' my drip, guess I'm settin' the trend
Louis backpack, hit the jet and I'm gone
I don't post what I do 'cause these niggas be clones
See these diamonds they hittin', these VVS stones
Got a championship ring, I just brought it home
FN is plastic, them bullets like pellets
This Givenchy jacket, this ain't Pelle Pelle
Sold out dates, you know I don't play
The last eight months straight, got no time for breaks
On they neck 'til it breaks, ain't pushin' no brakes
I got on two watches, I still come in late
It feel like my birthday, I'm gettin' this cake
I pop like I got it, I'm holdin' my weight
I control the projects, I'm pushin' this weight
I'm sippin' this sizzurp, I poured me an eight[Chorus: Gunna]
Sold-out dates, cash every day
I got you Hermés, I light up Blu-rays
This cheetah my pet, the condo a cage
Addicted to sex, I gotta get laid
My jacket Off-White, don't mean that it's beige

Yeah, ayy, look
[Verse 1: Drake & Gunna]
I bring up money, they change up the topic
I got a 19 and it fold in my pocket
She gave me her number, now I gotta block it
I'm mixin' the dirty bills in with the profit
Clean that shit up and I give it right back to him
If I don't fuck with him, then I can't rap with him
I wanna be there when somebody catches him
I want a witness to see that shit
Man, these folks, these folks gotta goddamn hear this shit, no cap
I bring up hits and they change up the topic
I got a 19 and it fold in my pocket
One hell of a year and a nigga still droppin'
They wanted to stop it, but they couldn't stop it
You told a story like shorty was feelin' you
She told a story like she split the bill with you
Look at my story, man, no one could write it
Now I see a million, I don't get excited
I might just YSL my shit, the Thugger way
Ain't no real sense in me goin' the other way
Cannot be seen in that shit from the other day
Virgil just chef'd me a whole different colorway
Please don't be stupid, it's Baby and Gunna
And Baby, he wanted her, so I just swung her
Next time I'm in Dallas, I'll look for another
You niggas fell off and you'll never recover
[Verse 2: Gunna]
Poured up some Hi-Tech and wait 'til it bubble
Young Gunna Gunna, I make this shit double
Hit Eliantte and left with a puddle
It's me, Drake, and Baby, you know you in trouble
Run up my check, my bitch sprinted the shuttle
Sign plus an M, bought a Benz for my brother
Painted all black, the interior butter
I drip like a leak and that's word to my mother
Yeah, came out the street, gotta sleep with a cutter
Family a beast, we gon' eat us a supper
My dick in her mouth like she teethin' or somethin'
Sound like it could be Drip Season this summer
Ain't no comparin' 'cause we number one
In black and white Chanel, I look like a nun
The police in shock, don't know who got a gun
Don't got what I got 'cause I shop in Milan
It's winter, I still took the top off the don
The kid was surprised that my trunk in the front
I know you a upset they don't shine in the sun
Cuban link look like a box of crayons
I'm still at the lot, tryna cop the Cayenne
I told the judge, ""Fuck it"", I'm goin' on the run
You want it, my dawgs'll look out for the bond
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
And I'm gettin' by, let 'em choose sides
We get M's in by the shoe size
I don't fuck with y'all type of kind
I done seen all y’all dickride
Bread winner like I'm Kevin Gates
And I swear to God, I don't get tired
From the trenches, now I'm goin'
Spend a whole hundred on a new wristwatch[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
Don't gotta drip, I can leave it to Gunna
Runnin' this shit, only been out two summers
That 4x4 truck, I post 300
Boy, at whoever, they know how I'm comin'
Ain't got no feelings, I'm here for the money
Treat every club like a Magic on Monday
Niggas ain't rich for real, they gettin' fronted
Gave her a dime, told her fix up her stomach
By the time she get back, I'ma switch up my number
Cap to her friend like I been on her bumper
Lately, I been the topic of discussion
Draco was foreign, they shipped it from Russia
Bad vibes at my show like I'm Usher
If she tell me ""No"" once, I won't even touch it
All I do is get her out here, abortion
Act like I've been rich, I used to have nothin'
Drizzy hit me up like he got another one
Money ain't even came in from the other one
Fuck it, I'm hot, so I might as well double up
Seem like everything I get on a number one
They tryna team up to beat me, they huddlin' up
Ever catch me out in traffic, I'm cuttin' up
Every city we go to, it be lit as fuck
Tryna put the police on us, get rid of us[Chorus: Lil Baby]
And I'm gettin' by, let 'em choose sides
We get M's in by the shoe size
I don't fuck with y'all type of kind
I done seen all y’all dickride

Invisible set, diamonds huggin' my piece
Book me for a show, I need eighty at least

Everything burnin' around me, I'm lit
Show a lil' attitude, swap out the bitch

I just popped me one of them one what-you-call-its and it boosted my stamina
Now I'm fucking her on the banister, guess I just East Atlanta'd her
I'm in an all-red drop tarantula, fuck a Challenger
Damn these hoes ain't got no manners, bruh, where's the manager?
I keep throwing rubber bandies up, ho, pull your panties up
'Cause you fuck like a granny fuck, you're just an amateur
This Patek Philippe gon' make this crooked judge try throw the book at me
I look like half a million worth of heroin when she look at me
But you ain't gotta fuck with me, my nig, but you're stuck with me
But how you called the cops on me, my nig? You grew up with me

I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high

I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high

Yeah, I'm both
Yeah, I had a drink, yeah, I smoked
Yeah, you think I need you but I don't
Just left out Dubai with all my folk
Open water, my location is remote
Shout-out Yachty but this ain't a lil' boat
This some shit I wrote about when I was broke
See, the power of the mind is not a joke
Man, I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get left-overs out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived
'Til I got it jumping at the crib
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean

I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high

Then pull me a new bitch
See that is a snowball effect
I got gold on my neck
Lookin' like a Super Bowl on my neck
I got a mansion full of marble floors
It look like I could go bowl in this bitch
Versace logos on bowls in this bitch
Like I'm a serial killer
I put the real in gorilla
I did this shit for my niggas
[Chorus: Travis Scott & Desiigner]
1500, all in singles (straight up!)
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round it go, 'round and 'round it go
'Round and 'round they go
I'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole
Than to get down in a hole
Champions, we run the city
Number one, they fallin' from the top
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round it go, 'round and 'round it go
'Round and 'round they go
I'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole
Than to get down in a hole
[Verse 6: Yo Gotti]
I'm Yo Gotti!
Reach for my chain is suicide
The car I drive fit two inside
They mad at Ye 'cause he all in the neighborhood
But he let them goons inside
Let's fuck up the neighborhood
Let's fuck up the neighborhood
Buy every house in this bitch
You know that the money good
My wrist in the kitchen go 'round and 'round
Play with the kid, I'ma gun you down
The roof on that Wraith in the lost and found
Official trap shit let me slow it down
Way more shit than a Pamper
All we rock is bandanas
Whips so nasty, no manners
I just got head in a Phantom
[Verse 7: Gucci Mane]
She say she don't want a chump, baby want a champ
She say money make her cum, Gucci make her damp (Gucci!)
1017's the Squad, Gucci Mane's the stamp
And he don't never sleep, he's a fuckin' vamp
I heard your bitch ride on the bus, you don't give a damn
My bitch drive a Lamb', you should call her ma'am
I love my Auntie Jane, but fuck Uncle Sam
I'm a walkin' money machine, check my Instagram
Niggas never test the kid so I don't have to cram
My city treat me like a king, I should wear a crown
And I don't really fuck around
I gave my bitch two mil' 'cause she stuck around
[Chorus: Travis Scott & Desiigner]
1500, all in singles (straight up!)
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round it go, 'round and 'round it go
'Round and 'round they go
I'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole
Than to get down in a hole
Champions, we run the city
Number one, they fallin' from the top
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round it go
'Round and 'round they go
I'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole
Than to get down in a hole"

King of the skreets
And when these suckas see me, they should bow to my feet
And kiss the ground underneath
I look down at the beef
That shit childish to me
Two hundred thousand to see me
And it's been sold out for weeks
Can't brush shoulders with me
These stones in my choker are 2 karats apiece
Look like boulders to me
Damn, who colder than me?
You think he colder than me?
You more bipolar than me
You talkin' crazy
I'm tryna book Beyoncé for my wedding day
I'm the type of nigga, spend a million on a wedding cake
Niggas hate, but hesitate
They hate to see ya elevate
I just left out the gym
I'm 'bout to take a swim and meditate
Woo!
Now it's time to celebrate
Ask me why I'm smilin'

And I might take your bitch and pay her bills

Don't wanna chill, that's how I feel today

Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'

She want me to save the day, but I ain't got a cape
She wanna see me every day, she wanna be my bae

I told you niggas I'm gon' be that fuckin' nigga
Everything be good 'til you doin' better than 'em
They wanna see a nigga shot or see me in the system
All you niggas out here poison like snake venom
Codeine in my liver, rockin' Balenciaga denim
I'm booted even when I'm sober, I don't need a jigga
They sendin' all my niggas on a fuckin' journey
I told that baby to come over 'cause I'm fuckin' horny
My mama told me, ""Kill these niggas, son, keep it goin'!""
I'm thug to the bone, but I'm still her baby boy
Lil' Kodak, boy, they hate to see you in a foreign
They miss when you was in that 'Yota kickin' doors

Yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm about to take off on these niggas, man
And I'm codeine dreaming
(And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming
And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming)
[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
I'm in Uranus right now, I think I seen a demon
I thought I left you back there in the cell or am I dreamin'?
Say I ain't dealing witcha, dawg, I'm going a different way
I broke up with my redbone, I went the milky way
I'm ridin' in a Wraith, feeling like I'm outer space
Stars on my sunroof,
Planet of the Apes
I couldn't wait until they released me, right back on the turf
I took off on you bustas, left you right on planet Earth
I feel like Jimmy Neutron, how I blast off on a verse
I know my son gon' like this song so I ain't finna curse
Know he gon' wanna explore the world so I'm gon' show him first
Say we just distinguished  beings, baby, me and you diverse
[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding

And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming
And I'm codeine dreaming[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
'Bout to take off on you peons and go back to Mars
'Bout to leave these peons behind like the Jackson 4
Tried to moonwalk on the moon and had to wax the floors
Tried to put me in a box and then I crashed the Porsche,
err!
'Bout to wake up in your biatch and go back and forth, yeah
Got her trapping out the the Fiat, she be back and forth, yeah
'Bout to put myself together, take it back apart, yeah
Got the codeine on my breath, it smell like caviar, yeah
Codeine dreams and they come true too
That's my spaceship, brp-brp!

I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling[Verse 3: Kodak Black]
'Bout to go to Saturn, heard they got the baddest species
You can hit me on my Galaxy, you tryna reach me
I went to Mars to get some Xanax bars to go to sleep
I'm in my Orange space shuttle flyin' two seats
I left Future in Pluto 'cause that boy was too geeked
End up playing Sudoku all the way in Mercury
I took too much of shrooms feel like I'm on Neptune
I'm with an alien, she show me what that neck do
And I'm a metamorphosis, you just a regular dude
You need a space suit to get up on this latitude
If she ain't foreign, then she boring, I need a Zorcon
You takin' morphine, homie, you a moron
[Chorus: Kodak Black & Lil Wayne]
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling (Yeah)

In the city, they treat me like Jesus is walkin'
I been through the pain and all of the torment
I'm sayin' His name, I make that important (What?)
Now it's time to give 'em hell
Ask my staff, I pay 'em well
This afternoon, a hundred goons pullin' up to SNL (What?)

Fivio Foreign,Story Time by Fivio Foreign,"[Intro]
Huh
[Verse]
Let me tell a little sad story about this young boy, grew up,
no pops in the crib
That nigga momma workin' so she couldn't really show him no love when he was a kid
(AyoAA)
He didn't even mean to do that incident
He was only eighteen when he  caught that bid
He in and out of jail, he ain't know how to move
He ain't know how to fight, he ain't know how to lose
He walked in the spot (Spot)
They told him, ""Strip, cough, squat"" (Uh)
The C.O. just told him that this is procedure but he knew in his mind that he was doin' a lot
He had to figure it out and then learn all the rules and then follow them, like it or not
He caught a new charge 'cause he had a little weed
Tryna sneak this shit in, it was right in his sock
Yeah, they had him in intake for like a week
They hate his guts, they think he killed police
They made it super cold with the AC
They ain't give him no blanket, they ain't give him no sheets
They put him in a cell with a dirty ass sink
He couldn't think, he couldn't sleep
They gave him no soap to wash his ass
They ain't give him no toothpaste to brush his teeth (Look)
He ain't know why they keep botherin' him, he was kinda scared, ain't wanna argue with him
Pacin' back and forth, they keep on followin' him
Couldn't take it no more, and he finally hit him (Yeah, look)
The C.O. done hit the button and they come and they helpin' him and run in and crack his ass
He just took a beatin' and unleashed the demon
He lookin' to grillin' and actin' bad
He ain't never been locked up before but he made up his mind
He like, ""Fuck it, if this how it start""
They couldn't count him out 'cause anybody who know lil' homie, know lil' homie got heart
He gon' adapt to his habitat, even if his habitat get dark (Uh)
He was a lil' fish when he jumped in the water
And then he grew into a shark (Then he grew into a shark)
Two years later (Uh), nine fights in, he found his religion
He started workin' out, takin' food, soups and respect 'cause this shit wasn't given
He wanted more for his life, he was sittin' in jail every night and his life wasn't hittin' (Life wasn't hittin')
And his life wasn't hittin' (His life wasn't hittin')
And his life wasn't, look (Nah)
Two years, he fought the case and he ain't worry 'bout it
In his mind he knew he ain't losin'
He got a paid lawyer, that's a good lawyer
And that lawyer do know what he doin'
They wanna take it to trial, so he take it to trial
But that little nigga goin' through it (Huh)
He was just holdin' it down for his mans 'cause he wasn't the one that was doin' the shootin' (Bow)
He didn't cop out to this damn lie, call home and found out his man died
He looked up to the sky like, ""Damn, why?""
'Cause he's locked in the cell and he can't slide
All hell break lose when that man cry, you can see the demon in his damn eyes
That nigga a vampire, hah (Bow)
If he want you dead, then it's verified (Bow)
And he went back in his cell and he thought to himself like, ""Damn, I feel a lil' stupid""
He got a big gun in the crib but he's stuck in the jam and he can't even use it

Nigga, who want smoke with me?
Who want smoke with me?
Who want smoke with me?
Who want smoke with me?
Nigga, who want smoke with me?
[Verse 1: Nardo Wick]
Who want smoke with me? I'm tryna fuck a nigga lungs up
They be like, ""Nardo, put them damn guns up""
Fuck that, say, ""Big brother, bring them guns out""
When it's smoke, we get to spinnin' while the sun out
I ain't never lackin', I pump gas with my gun out
Scream out, ""What's happenin'?"" Then get to bussin' 'til it run out
All these niggas hidin', I'm likе where they at? It ain't no fun now
7.62s big as hеll'll knock a nigga lungs out
One, two, three, four (Kick your door, get on the floor)
Five, six, seven, eight
(Don't make no noise, I'll eat your face)
Nine, ten, eleven, we ain't gon' say that number, we don't fuck with jakes
I'ma kill fourteen niggas if thirteen bitch niggas play
I think my Draco might be gay (Why?), 'cause he blow niggas
I just got a brand new Lolli, that's a four-nickel
Call me Nardo yes-man, I don't know niggas
You can send your best man, you gon' lose your best hitter

Outside with y'all big homie, be on, I keep them folks with me (Bop)
Got it back in blood, y'all just don't know, that's how it 'posed to be (Shh)

Uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, who the fuck is that?
Bro, go check the door, look out the window, don't forget
the strap

I be on this shit wherever I'm at, I learned that from the 'Raq
He gon' drink whatever a nigga sell him just to say he high
They be like, ""He wasn't even with that shit,"" whenever a nigga die (He gone)
Emergency room gon' always lie to y'all whenever a nigga die (True)
Sayin' a nigga stable as they check, just to keep y'all quiet (Let's get it)
Bronem stomp his ass
Better do what Nardo said, 'cause niggas die for pumpin' gas (Boom)
Why you act like that shit so exclusive? Bitch, that's public ass (Public ass)
Can't no nigga we don't fuck with come around, we stomp his ass
Nardo voice, creep up out that cut, we like shh, shh

Ayy, who you killed? Steady talkin' like you did a drill (Gang)
We gon' kill you sober, who done told you that I need a pill? Gang[Verse 3: 21 Savage]
Real-deal stepper, put my toe on that boy
You Mickey Mouse, bitch, you went and told on that boy
All my guns come with a switch 'cause I'm fuckin' rich
I don't type no tweets or throw no fists, get shot in your shit
Old niggas steady tryna diss, fuck up off my dick
Caught him leaving bingo with his bitch and we sent a blitz
Nardo tryna fight me 'bout the stick, it's his turn to blick
I can't even roll my opps in shit, pussies don't exist
One, two, three, four niggas mad I fucked they ho
Five, six, seven, eight pussies that got hit with this K

Who want smoke? It's free (Smoke, it's free)

Nardo Wick,Me or Sum by Nardo Wick (Ft. Future & Lil Baby),"[Part I]
[Intro: Future]
Drop your location, she think she me or sum' (Hendrix)
Put on my chains, now she think she me or sum'
She keep a Glock in her bag, she think she me or sum' (Pluto)
VVS rocks with the cash, she think she me or sum' (Keep it Z3N)
[Verse 1: Future]
Came out hustlin' with the bag, oh no
I can't get it to the guys, oh
Bitch can't see me in binoculars
Run it up, check up with Prada
You runnin' your racks up, I'm proud of you
All bad bitch eat seafood
Took the hot box on the detour
Came back, red on the bottom of her shoe
Postin' the devil, she thinkin' she me or sum'
Canary yellow, she thinkin' she me or sum'
Step like a stepper, she drippin' Emilio Pucci
She think she me or sum'
She barely ever poppin' outside
But when she do (When she do), tryna kill sum'
My number one hitter, always movin' in silence
She the truth, real one
You can ask her if she gang, gang
She gon' tell you she rep the same thing I do (Yeah)
She not my main thing
But on the weekends, she lovin' my crew, lovin' my crew
[Part II]
[Verse 2: Nardo Wick]
She said she got a man, I act deaf, I don't hear her
Come here, girl, stop playin', let me put it in your liver (Put it in your liver)
Eat what's in my pants, baby, don't gotta go to dinner
I stole her heart, thou shall not steal, I'm sorry, I'm a sinner
Let her put my chains on, now she think she me or somethin'
Got a special ringtone, when it beep, I know she comin'
She just put her hair on, now she think she flee or somethin'
Nardo hit that G spot, when she scream, I know she cummin'
I put her in LV, on my feet is LV
I think I'm a lover boy, sing to your bitch like Elvis
My bitch in the front seat, my other bitch in back seat
Nardo, who your other bitch? I'm talkin' 'bout my choppy
Know I keep a bankroll, baby, count my bankroll
Put it in your purse, she say, ""It's too much, bae, it won't go
Too much, bae, it won't fold, too much, bae, I'm gon' choke""
I know I got a lot of y'all, but, baby, you my favorite ho
She love me, she love me not
She love me, she love me not
She love me, she love me not
She love me, she love me not
[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
Baby in this bitch
Like, ""Let me through here,"" I need millions for the new year
Send a threat, I send my crew there
Know they hate how big I blew up
Got that check for real, went Audemars Piguet and bought my boo one
Think my favorite car's my blue one, pop that shit for real, I do this
Put my heart inside my safe deposit box 'cause I ain't gon' use it
I made forty million last year, and that's just off my music
I done finally got the mothafuckin' ball, and I ain't gon' lose it
Seem like everybody snoozin' while I'm steadily improvin'
I get money like I'm Jewish, I'm gon' be the one
She got all them bracelets up her arm, look like she me or somethin'
She get new Chanel whenever she want like it's free or somethin'
I been buyin' Birkin bags for bitches like they three for one
Excuse my French, I'm sorry, momma, this Phantom cost five hunnid
I been lit for five summers, everyone know how I'm comin'
Real exotic bags for thirty-five, we got our side pumpin'
Niggas don't want war with us, I spin until my last hunnid, yeah[Verse 4: Future]
Rackies on rackies, now she think she me or sum'
Dressin' like she tecky, now she think she me or sum'
Count up cash really fast, now she think she me or sum'
Keep the extendo in her bag, now she think she me or sum'
Walked in with a baddie, now she think she me or sum'
Gon' drop the addy, now she think she me or sum'
Bust down an Audemars, now she think she me or sum'
Cop another foreign car, now she think she me or sum'
Bitch don't need a stylist, she must think she me or sum'
Always goin' viral, she must think she me or sum'
Turn up on a bad ho, she must think she me or sum'
Diamonds on her rings and her chain, think she me or sum'
Posted up, runnin' with her gang, think she me or sum'

We can shoot all day (We do it all day, nigga, why you say that?)

The clip hold a hundred, but I'm gon' only put eighty 'cause I don't wanna jam when I squeeze
I ain't no nanny, but I'm gon' rock-a-bye baby if a lil' nigga play with me
Ran in the house, said it was time to slide, just wanna see who gon' freeze
Nobody froze, everybody ready to go, they ready to step for me
Ain't nobody shook, everybody got that look, they ready to uh-uh-uh
If I up my stick, you ain't even much gotta look, I bet you it uh-uh-uh
My shooter a demon, nah, he don't got no name, we call him uh-uh-uh

You always got excuses and you know I be on top of things
Punctual my proper name, on the dot is not your aim
Although we in love, we are not the same (Uh)

You lackin' (Ayy), you trippin', you slackin' (Ayy)
Impatient-ly waitin' (Yeah, ayy)
Confused, like ""What happened?""
How you get a attitude 'cause I'm gettin' mad?
'Cause you wanna take twenty minutes and a half
And on top of that, I gotta get gas
Ahh, the freeway, picked up traffic
What the fuck is you doin'? We gotta dip-dip-dip-dip-dip

""Hey! How you doin'?"" ""I'm good"" ""I ain't too bad""
""Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha,"" hit her with a few fake laughs

She talkin' my ear off, it's sympathy I lack
I care about one thing: where the fuck you at? (Ayy)
Anyway, gotta pay a little more

Gotta jet 'cause the boat leave at eight
And we got supper on the upper deck and the orchestra
Gon' play that shit I scored (Woo), for LV Abloh projects (Yeah)

Nigo,Hear Me Clearly by Pusha T & Nigo,"[Chorus]
Hear me clearly, if y'all niggas fear me, just say y'all fear me
[Verse 1]
These drug dealer Rollies is my TikTok and Triller
Insecure bitches get lip fillers
Covered in white like bridezilla and never been caught
So what's the Shiggy dance for a brick nigga?
Extracurricular, art buyer, 812 'Rari driver
Spent six just to make the roof, Harry Potter
Kilogram Kickstarter, push a brick harder
Left my elbow in the pot, à la Vince Carter
Compared to two martyrs but I'm chasin' moguls
Bosses meet for Hamachi in the back of Nobu
No phones allowed, no phones allowed
Cell towers gon' ping from the nearest cloud
My JanSporters, my transporters and Jan's daughter
Who put up extra bedsheets to block the camcorders?
You place orders, I hedge bets
Promises are when you follow through with your threats, nigga
[Chorus]
Hear me clearly, if y'all niggas fear me
Just say y'all fear me, fuck all these fairy tales
Hear me clearly, if y'all niggas fear me
Just say y'all fear me, fuck all these fairy tales
[Verse 2]
Buy your bitch a Richard Mille, if she like Meeks
Let no nigga claim rich, and let 'em buy you sneaks
Wish upon a star that's beyond yo' reach
Or you can lay with him in misery, and grind yo' teeth
Let a brick-nigga help you find your peace
G-Wagon, your seats, Gs cover your pleats
Ten toes down, Loewe cover the cleats
Dope sell itself, got a trunk full of receipts
Is you looking for me, or are we looking for Meech?
Stand on my standards, expanded with the Ziploc
Even if a nigga number better, never clique hop
Never tell a jeweller what you spent for your wristwatch
And we don't fuck bitches who fuck niggas on TikTok
See the difference 'tween me and them
I move to a different drum like EDM
This coke speaks to my soul like a medium, fucking comedians
[Chorus]
Hear me clearly, if y'all niggas fear me
Just say y'all fear me, fuck all these fairy tales
Hear me clearly, if y'all niggas fear me
Just say y'all fear me, fuck all these fairy tales"

[Verse: A$AP Rocky]
I just want my credit like I'm Soulja
Camo like Rambo, big draco 'cross the shoulder
I'm fine-tuned on iTunes if you shuffle
Test the boy Le Suess like I came to tune your motor
Motherfuck a mumble rapper, I'd rather be a mogul
Million dollar market deals closin' on my mobile
Keep the grass cut, got a phobia for cobra
You should low-key fuck the world when I'm vulgar
Man, I used to listen to that nigga when I was younger
Found out he's a poser when I got a lil' older
My bitch used to model for the Vogue, but she older
A truce and a foe, sittin' 'round watchin' poker
No buns in the oven, or babies in the stroller
Just guns in the cupboard, and some ladies comin' over
See I'm a pretty boy, manicures with the rollers
And babushkas on the head, like grandmothers and the Roman
Some women throw me bras, some women throw me roses
Might even flash a titty while she on a nigga shoulders
They goin' crazy at my shows, she passed out if I noticed her
Yeah, we in the buildin' 'til the shit is for foreclosure
Yeah, we not the same, I ain't tryna play it like a lame nigga
Switch a gang, switch the beat, like the track that's playin' (That's playin')

This shit so clean and bright, bold (Yeah)
The gold got a grip hold
All these Lucky Charms like a thick bowl
The diamonds all appraised (Nigga), yeah
Y'all go to Avianne and y'all get a lease in that bitch
My earlobes got them yellow boogers like I sneezed in that bitch (Achoo)
Your 808s is dry, you need to put some grease in that bitch
And let it sit, nigga, fuck what you heard (Fuck what you heard)
And fuck rap, I make a living off that four-letter word (GOLF WANG)
One-stop shop, nigga, just to sell them shoes
The profit margins lookin' higher than them airplane views
Y'all getting fucked in your deals, and they share that lube
I push the cum-colored Beamer and the inside blue (Skrrrt)
I push an Elon too, and the 675
The Longtail like the mane that's on A$AP Lou
Whips, whips, whips, whips, Kunta started a fight
The 720 ordered and I still go ride me a bike
But don't follow in yours (Nah), Vill behind me in sight (Yeah)
My niggas strictly like 9s, like young Mike and his type (Pew-pew)
Rip, you better zip that lip and zip up quick
And shit, he'd probably suck my dick then kiss his bitch (Mwah)
It's two sides to each coin, I call heads (Heads)
Been countin' so much goddamn coin, my palm red (Uh)
I spend it on some books and some diamonds that shed light

Run in your trap, nigga take all the pesos

This nigga think I'm rappin', I'ma make this chopper sing
I'm shootin' shit with my dog, you can call me Max Payne

Kill him, beat the case, I hit him with the K
Hah, I mean, I hit my lawyer with the case

This nigga think I'm rappin', I'ma make this chopper sing

Look, baby, listen, them hoes was lyin'
Here, take a tissue, don't like you cryin'
I wouldn't cheat bae, you're just too perfect
I cannot lose you, it's just not worth it
I know they tweeting, them hoes is cappin'
I thought I told you ain't nothing happen
I never want you to sit there clueless
Baby, I love you, I thought you knew this
Stop gettin' angry, stop all the madness
We meant to be, look how long we lasted
Sadness, I ain't eat in days like I'm fastin'
Blasted, I wanna be with you 'til my casket
I'm just disappointed in your actions
Then you get upset at my reactions
To be honest, babe, I'm just passin'
We were doing straight and now we're slanted
[Chorus]
I want you in my life, girl, fuck a solo
The arguments and fights, I can't do it no more
You asked am I alright and I really don't know
You said I can be replaced, baby, that's a low blow
I want you in my life girl fuck a solo
The arguments and fights, I can't do it no more
You asked am I alright and I really don't know
You said I can be replaced, baby, that's a low blow
[Verse 2]
Baby, I understand your mental, I need you to know
I got work to get done, I got the shows on the road
Secure the bag so we can take a trip to Italy
I know I’m a pain so I’m confused to why you into me
I guess this is love and I’m certain that it is
I see you got baby fever, one day we should have some kids
We in love, why we fighting? We just need to face it
It’s a marathon, you last longer when you pace it
I just want you to kno-o-ow I just want us to gro-o-ow
When we be fightin’ I feel so low, though
Are we gon’ last? I don’t know no more, I don’t know no more
Put your foot on the gas, fuck a stop sign, go (Yeah)
I think we thinking too much, let’s just go with the flow
[Chorus]
I want you in my life girl fuck a solo
The arguments and fights, I can't do it no more
You asked am I alright and I really don't know
You said I can be replaced, baby, that's a low blow (Yeah)[Verse 3]
Last verse was before the breakup
Still wondering if we gon' make up
Can't sleep girl, nah, I gotta stay up
I miss the nights when we used to cake up
Used to text ""good morning,"" now I get a ""GM""
Washed up rappers in your fuckin’ DM
Still wondering if you went to see him
Stayed out 'til the morning, after fuckin' PM
You got back in the morning, I'm talkin' 6 in the morning
Our connection got boring
You gon’ make me glo up and go and cop me a foreign
You been sleepin’ on me lately, girl, it sound like you snoring (Yeah)
Used to be my baby, now I call you my ex
Them basketball players only want you for sex
Them internet niggas look at you as a check
Girl, I loved your ass to death, treated you with respect
Took you to the islands, girl, that came from the heart
I ain't really feel the love, I was doing my part
It's to much its  a whole list of shit, I don't know where to start
Go and find another man, girl, you cute and you smart"
DDG,Moonwalking in Calabasas (Remix) by DDG (Ft. Blueface),"[Verse 1: DDG]
Ballin' since I was a jit
Way before Oakland and filmin' the skits
I had a goal to get rich
Mama was strugglin' payin' the rent
I couldn't help her with shit
Hate that I'm feelin' so stuck in this bitch (Devo this shit hard)
Car broke down, can't fix that shit
I cried at night, I'll admit that shit
'02 old, I'll whip that bitch
She left me 'lone but I miss that bitch
If she text right now, I'll hit that bitch
Old friends like, ""How you get that lit?""
Same old me but they think I switched
Fuck old friends, I don't know that bitch
Racks too big, can't fold that shit
I ain't get none when I owed that shit
Mama, I told you we gon' be okay
Whippin' the Benz and she live in L.A.
Tryna thank God, but don't know what to say
[Verse 2: Blueface]
Don't call that lil' ass place no estate
Unless it came with a pool and a gate
Check the rear before I pull in the gate
All my watches flooded just like a lake
Lately I've been showing up extra late
Rich nigga take her on a cheap date
4 for 4 Wendy's get her a plate
Love when these nuts all up in her face
She say ""Wow, never met a nigga with dick and a house""
Spit in her mouth, diggin' her out
With a choppa in the couch for a rat or a mouse, uh
[Chorus: DDG]
Mm, I feel like Michael Jackson
Moonwalkin' through the Calabasas
Louis bag, gotta hold the ratchet
Just in case a nigga want some action
Mm, got some millions, but it's just a fraction
Spendin' money for my satisfaction
Benjamins, we don't fuck with Jacksons
[Verse 3: DDG]
Bet when I drop, they don't post that shit (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
All good though, I'ma note that shit
When I blow, you'll owe me, bitch
Humble-ass nigga but I know I'm rich (Yeah, rich as fuck)
Fuck that shit, I know I'm lit
If we beef, I'll fuck your bitch
All of the niggas I beef on the internet
I hit up all of they bitches and get 'em wet
Call her a Uber, I hit 'em and send 'em back
Do it in silence cause players ain't into that
No, oh, I hit his bitch on the low, oh
She said your dick game was so-so
And she had told me you broke, oh

Get too close, it go beep-beep-beep-beep-beep
Road Runner, all he heard was meep-meep-meep
Nyoom, seven-fifty in the horse
Hopped off the porch and I crashed the Porsche
Hop out the bed and I smash the whore
Knock-knock, guess who's at the door
Oops, forgot I ordered that Dior (Bop)
Came in straight from Europe (Bop)

Went to Texas for a few days
Wanted to scout out the properties
Lookin' like I won a lottery
None of the hate really bother me
YouTube three years, they don't wanna see me blow
They don't wanna hear the flow
But this usually how it go
Bankroll, bankroll
The bank tellers know my name
My life now not the same
I got money with the fame
PayPal with the transfer, brought my momma straight to tears
Get her a 'Rari to steer, she ain't pay rent in years
Couldn't park at the store, I got butterfly doors
One space, need more
Somebody rally the score
My music is hot, bitch nigga give me my credit
Sending shots without a medic
Four bands from my edits
My exes, ""Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha"" they regret it, heh
Yeah nigga, I said it, mm
Two hunnid bands on my debit, mm
Got enough education, I'm a college dropout, heh
Same nigga that'll doubt be the main one beggin' for my clout
[Interlude 1]
Yeah
I mean these niggas just, you know, they don't understand what I been through man, and, you know?
I do all this shit on my own, my nigga, you know what I'm sayin'?And I'm just out here tryin' to get respect, but at the same time it's like, ""Fuck you,"" you know what I'm sayin'? But, I guess its just me, ventin' right now
It's whatever though
Yeah
[Verse 2]
Why you rap about the money? I ain't never had shit
Told myself, ""Don't quit, watch how you get rich""
Niggas see me in Pontiac they 'on't never ever wanna speak
Sent a text, ""Let's meet,"" nigga, I been here for weeks
I'on't usually like, go home 'cause I know niggas hate a lot
I'd probably get shot, and we don't even got cops
Cold case on my big bro, but we all know who did it
10K we'll split it, guarantee they won't miss it
Niggas really used to struggle, mama really had to hustle
Two jobs had to juggle, we'll be good, now I'm humble
Private client at the chase, I got a personal banker
Ksubi jeans on my ass, used to be at Walmart buying Wrangler
Gas station 2am, bought some Hershey's out the wrapper
Don't compare me to a rapper, I make more than a rapper
Go to school for 4 years, 50K be a salary
I just made 50K in a week, take a pic for my gallery
[Interlude 2]
I don't really be tryna stunt on anybody but its just like, you gotta understand when you come from nothin' you know, you gotta have something to show for it, man, you know what I'm sayin'? Where I come from, niggas ain't too successful, you know?
So, I like to show what I got
50K in a week, nigga, no bullsh', just sayin'
Yeah[Verse 3]
Check neck, check wrist
Date just with the Cubans
100K on the ice, So I'm cautious when I'm movin'
I don't go to the club, pussy is not that important
Threw my contact sortin', I got hoes out in Portland
I notice, we don't talk too often
You gon' claim we was best friends when I'm dead and gone in my coffin
I don't hang around you niggas, now you probably know the reasons
I be chillin' by myself out the way tryna get through the seasons
Niggas think I'm a goofy, let me make a little statement
Don't come at me reckless, them videos for entertainment
I did the shit on my own, I got the check on my own
Bitch, I'm flyer than a drone, so you better watch your tone
10K for a feature, I had to get off the bleachers
Why the fuck would you stay in school when you makin' more than a teacher?
Nigga I did it, I did it, I owe God all the glory
Could've been dead and broke but you know they don't wanna hear my story
[Outro]
Yeah
Man, I just wanna say, you know, I'ma continue to do what I do, man
You know what I'm sayin', I'm not gon' let these...these no good ass niggas, you know what I'm sayin', try and break me down and, you know what I'm sayin', tell me I'm not good enough, you know what I'm sayin', but, I'ma just let this music take off and let it speak for itself, you know?

Plugged in like a socket
Career shooting like a rocket
They refresh till I drop it (Ooh)
[Chorus]
Niggas be talkin', but ain't 'bout that action
Bet when they see me, ain't nothin' gon' happen
Six bitches hop in the Bimmer, no cappin'

Used to be broke used to sleep on the floor
I just dropped 40 racks at the store
Google my net worth, then times it by 4
That's disrespectful, they know I got more

But I don't give a fuck no mo', ayy (Fuck 'em!)
Old relationships, lessons learned, so I right all my wrongs (Right 'em, yeah!)

Bridges burn after fucking with me
You fall off after fucking with me
You get left after fucking with me
You better off never fucking with me[Chorus]

This my bitch, when she whine and trip I give her a pacifier
And I grip, when she ride my stick, I fuck her lashes out
Two of my homeboys tryna go to war, gotta make 'em hash it out
First thing I was taught when I was growin' up, don't keep a stash in the house
Turn a hood bitch 'to a princess, teach a hood bitch how to invest
I come from the bottom where I'm from, boy I'm a legend like I'm Denzel

I do not play by the rules

I do not play by the rules, they can not slow me down
They see that I'm makin' moves, wan' be my homie now
Shawty is datin' ole dude, but she wanna blow me now
Don't tell me what you gon' do, you gotta show me now
[Chorus]
I'm in the city with biddies, they showin' they titties, they fuckin' with me
Pull up to Dyckman, Dominican shorties, be really be lookin' O.D
Moncler coat in the NYC with a P.Y.T. and she all on me
Cartier shades and it's dark outside, but I only got 'em on 'cause I'm high O.D
[Verse 1]
Move like Obama, I just bought a llama
I named it Osama, it solve all the drama
Just got a comma, spent that on my momma
'Cause being dead broke gave the family trauma
I'm givin' all of these hood niggas hope
Showin' them niggas, ain't gotta sell dope
Take a percentage and show you the ropes
Business is business, you know how that go
I got the money, the fame, and bitches
I'm fuckin' your missus, she really don't love you
I'ma just fly her ass out of the country
And play with the kitty, but never gon' cuff you
Five star meals when I eat these days, my homie just told me I'm bougie
Friday night's in the L.A lights, let's make a fuckin' movie

Get that gas and I roll that gas, and I hit that gas, now I'm high so fast
Rolls Royce Wraith with a V-12 engine, If I hit that gas, I'ma swerve right pass
Young rich nigga, I don't take no shit
I'll beat a nigga ass 'cause I ain't no bitch
Ain't no cap this is real life nigga, 'cause it ain't no script and it ain't no skit
Flex O.D. 'cause I made me a milli' and I did it own my own, and my childhood rough
Bad bitch with me and she off that stuff, by twelve I'ma fuck, if she cuff, that's tough
You think you know but you really don't know, I had to choose the right path I would go
Could've sold drugs 'cause I really was poor, but I was smart, man, I know how that go

Ktwice on the beat

Landed fresh on the city I'm stuck in baggage
Tunnel vision for money, I'm doing damage
Using all of my struggles to my advantage
But this hate that I'm getting is slowly making me savage
Getting sick and I'm traveling coast to coast
I got money I'm valid enough to boast
Breadwinner my pockets is stuffed with toast
I don't know you little nigga don't tag me in what you post

These girls don't want me for me
They just finesse on the clout
These niggas don't support me
I make a move and they doubt
These niggas copying me
I call these niggas my clones
These niggas hatin' on me
Gotta do this on my own
[Verse 2]
They ask me why I don't talk
I just sit back and observe
And I done blew up so quick
I just kept straight while you curve
It's back to back like ping pong
I know my ex vibe to my song
I been in love for too long
Why they keep doing me wrong
These days love do not exist
Niggas not faithful and girls don't commit
So we go clubbing and be drinking and shit
Boasting on snap and it's not even lit
I'd rather have just one girl to myself
All of this drinking not good for my health
I got a sold out show on the 12th
I just be working and building my wealth (aye)

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you

Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (Can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break (Were made outta plastic, fake)
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again (I was tangled up in your drastic ways)

Broke my heart, oh, no, you didn't
Fuck sippin', I'ma down a whole bottle
Hard liquor, hard truth, can't swallow
Need a bartender, put me out my sorrow
Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo
With a new woman, tell me she from Colorado
And she love women, she'll be gone by tomorrow
Who am I kiddin'?
All this jealousy and agony that I sit in
I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon
I just want real love, guess it's been a minute
Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in (I don't fit in)
Tell me, what's the secret to love? I don't get it
Feel like I be runnin' a race I'm not winnin'
Ran into the devil today and she grinnin'

To break my heart, oh, no, she didn't

Fuck givin', I'ma take, not borrow

I can't reverse it

Last time I saw you, it ended in a blur
I woke up in a hearse
You said, ""You loved me first"" (First)
One thing my dad told me was, ""Never let your woman know when you're insecure""
So I put Gucci on the fur
And I put my wrist on iceberg
One thing my heart tells me is
""Flex on a ho every time they're insecure""
I guess you came through, I'm running from you
Is your love for real? (For real? For real?)
Is your love really true?

Eight fly rides just to drive in my garage

Stay sky high (Twisted), fly with the stars (Twinkle, twinkle)
G4 Flights
, 80 grand large (Ballin'!)
So we lean with it, pop with it (Bankhead)
'Vertible Jones, mean with the top missin'

I'm sittin' clean with the bottom kitted (Do it!)
I hopped out, saggy jeans and my rock glistened (Ballin'!)
But I spent about 8 grand
Mami on stage doin' the rain dance

She let it hit the floor, made it pop (What else?)
Got my pedal to the floor screamin', ""Fuck the cops!"" (Do it!)

Step out, show me what you all about
Flashbacks to last night of me ballin' out

1 AM, we was at the club (What happened?)

We put the lazers on Glocks (Glock)

See the face on our watch, put ya face on our cock (head)
I keep the Luger hugged
Show you how to use a snub
Whoopty-whoo, fuck around be you I plug (you)
I don't do the drugs (nah), baby I move the drugs (yes)
Right on the computer love, it sound like computer love (computer love)

Jim Jones,"60 Rackz (Remix) by Jim Jones (Ft. Cam'ron, Lil Wayne & T.W.O. (rapper))","This is the Vmix! How big said it
When the Rémy's in the system
Well I got a 60 clip on me
Like an AK in my pocket, bitch
Get money
Or should I say young money
Ay killa you know the rules dip set for life
[Hook: Jim Jones]
I'm all about that motherfucking paper ho
This song goes out to all my money making hoes
60 rackz in my pocket, 60 rackz in my jeans
60 rackz in my pocket, top back when I lean
I pull up in that motherfucking Phantom Ghost
This song goes out to all my niggas getting dough
60 rackz in my pocket, 60 rackz in my jeans
60 rackz in my pocket top back when I lean
[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
60 racks thats no dough, mattes fact thats ho dough
I made that when I transported, back and forth taking Nodoze
Rolex rose gold,
my neck so cold
She seen't that quarter chill, V in black, quarter mill
We don't shop at saveraux, 60 thou for the roll
Drop top foreign flow, this is not affordable
Wrist cold, caught the flu, Cartier said quarter to
She sucked my dick, swallowed it, my watch still said quarter to
Dipset, Young Money, niggas know that that money grown
Wanna talk to me, you better talk to me, from that pool deck of my summer home (Can't hear you niggas)
My summer home, pool deck with like a hundred on
Who's a threat? Got a pool net, and my jewels wet like a thunderstorm
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Swear to God I go so hard, they call me Tunechi fuck 'em all
Can't pack no gun, so I keep a knife like that fuckin' Chucky doll
I'm at your neck like a shawl, on your ass like some drawers
I got 3 hoes with me, fuck, I look like Santa Claus
And I got bad bitches all over me, real niggas that roll with me
And we get off weight like that one bitch from Floetry
Got a pair of pants with 4 pockets, 15K in each of 'em
Do the math you mo'fucka,
I'm on my Robin Leach, blood
Skating with my homeboys, talking shit smoking weed
I oversee everything, niggas call me overseas
Young mulah mothafucka, click clack boo ya, mothafucka
60 rackz in my pocket, try to jack and get bodied
Young Tunechi[Hook]
[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
I got an ill gift, I'm real swift, they be like, ""Damn, he still rich""
When I send my men in black listen none of them niggas is will smith
I sell coke, I deal piff, when I ride by in that black on black
Ménage à trois with two double D's, come to see that's racks on racks
They ship it in, I give it to ya on the ground or in the air
They drop it off, they're like LeBron in the 4th quarter, I give it there
I be me, you be you, apologies to Groovie Lou
Sorry, brah, I ain't fuckin' with mase, yea yea tell 'em you be cool
Me I rep that Hud 6,
I ain't even gon' play with 'em
Harlem Underworld for real,
you can fool Wale and them
The MAC, well, that's black on black, true fact I'm crack on tracks
Play around, and I'll lay you down, 60 racks in your cap, nigga

Jim Jones,Summer Wit' Miami by Jim Jones (Ft. Trey Songz),"[Intro: Jim Jones & (Trey Songz)]
You see rap music is subliminal
But the music for us is like our own diary
Something like a confession
They tell me life is a bitch (That's a summer with Miami)
She somethin' like the seasons just like mother nature
She comes and go as she please
Thats why they get their period once a month (Yeah)
I say that to say this if you think that bitch
The summer is yours (That's a summer with Miami)
She could be cheating on you
Ya heard
[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
It's got me feelin' like opium
I'm tryna dance with the loaded M
Open a bottle and it goes around
I'm leavin' drunk 'bout 4 A.M
And watch me jump up in a Dolce Benz
Top down with the pokey rims
And now I'm swervin' so you know I'm bent
I lost count, who knows what I spent
I recall nine Cliques
Bitches steppin' on my Nike sneakers
With one hand in the sky and the other hand was on her thigh
I was grindin' to the beat with my hammer on my side
Now the G's only as we speed to the Rolex
And three or four G's is what we sneeze at the Rolex
Playing some, glance at my Chopard, it's 'bout 6 A.M
You think the night is over but it just begin
They say Club Space like Bad Boys 2
You can see the snow bunnies doin' what bad girls do
Thats ecstasy weed that had girl to
Scoop the bitch that had keys that sellin' fast off blue
Now I'm speedin' to the telly got the Porsche behind
Tryna get in her belly the only thought on my mind
Like damn, not tryna be pushy or nothing
But since the strip joint girl, I should have been fucking
[Hook: Trey Songz]
Spendin' my summers with the drop top low
Throwin' my 100s at the top notch hoes
And we smokin' on the top notch dro
That's a summer with Miami
Bottle in the air, livin' without a care
Shawty beside me, blowin' through her hair
Hold on, no
That's a summer with Miami
[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
I can't keep it long anymore
I be with my girl when it starts to snow, I get bored
And when you love three women, it's hard to keepin' up with the lies
You see spring's my first love, I started creepin' with July
Used to say I had some shows, catch a plane to M-I
Then I started trickin' dough and bought a Range for July
Mama said I'm love sick over this hot ass hoochie
And I first seen her when I told Nas I'd slap off his kufi
We don't play disrespect but that was the day that me met
Summer jam '02, I hit the stage with my set
But her man, he was from Brooklyn she still slipped me the number
She said he's on vacation, so get with me this summer
Then I been flirtin' with her over the past two years
Now she hates seein' me in the winter, ain't gon' last through the year
So now I'm lookin' at winter like life's an adventure
And then when June comes, I'll be gone 'til September
Now would you hate me for that?
I know your heart's cold could you wait 'til I'm back
I'm just a sucker for love
But a nigga hold you down if you wanna fuck with a thug[Hook: Trey Songz]
Spendin' my summers with the drop top low
Throwin' my 100s at the top notch hoes
And we smokin' on the top notch dro
That's a summer with Miami
Bottle in the air, livin' without a care
Shawty beside me, blowin' through her hair
Hold on, no
That's a summer with Miami"

I think my critics need to hear this
Or anyone who doubts my political awareness
I'm what you call a democratic with an automatic
A rebel and a bezel when I just ordered the Patek
You could build a wall as tall as the sky (To the moon)
We all know the coke still go far from the sky
Papi had a room with a wall full of pies
This is America, baby, where we fall for the lies (Impeach the president)
We never had much, but we had us (Uh-uh)
And even when the bills didn’t add up
We cooked up coke and it was crills that we bagged up
We sold in broad day and police still didn't bag us
I be ready to kill one of you MAGA's (Fuckers)
Shit, I’m throwin' shots, man, you still throwin' daggers
And my thoughts on the legalization
And they tryna turn weed into a legal libation
Why won't they legalize Haitians? (Sak Pasé?)
And throw on the Cubans too
I told my jeweler he could throw on a Cuban too
Or bust down a Rollie, it's frozen at two to two (West Side)
I took a private jet and you know where I flew the crew (LA)
Them coconut drinks that come with umbrellas in 'em
In the rain, we buy Rolls's that come with umbrellas in 'em (Facts)
The transition, baby, that was the hardest part
Police pulled me over and they still ripped my car apart (Don’t shoot)

[Verse 2: Rick Ross & Marc Scibilia]
Pushin' Phantoms, so they feel I'm preachin' propaganda
Say a prayer for my niggas or we light a candle
All the squares in your circle, time to change the channel
Or unplug the television 'cause this shit is mental (Huh)
My sneakers Chanel, Grim Reaper for real
I get beats from Pharrell, you should see how I live
Kids in Montessori school, logos in the pool
I done put in all my work, no longer holding tools
Look into my eyes, you can see the murders
Smell the kilos on me, now we flippin' burgers
Ride through the ghetto, look for shit to purchase
Do it for the fam, don't forget your purpose
When you sellin' grams, then you just a merchant, nigga
When you sellin' grams, then you just a merchant
Eyes open wide, slither with a serpent (Woo)
Closed casket meaning God, close the curtains (This ghost in my head)
Meaning God, close the curtains (This ghost in my head)
Meaning God, close the curtains (This ghost in my head)
God, close the curtains (Ghost in my head)
Oh Lord[Chorus: Marc Scibilia]
Shine a light on my feet, Lord, watch my steps
This ghost in my head, ghost in my head
Got the world after me but I can't look back
This ghost in my head, ghost in my head
[Outro: Marc Scibilia]
Shine a light on my feet, Lord, watch my steps
Ghost in my head, ghost in my head
Got the world after me but I can't look back
Ghost in my head, ghost in my head"
Joyner Lucas,Isis by Joyner Lucas (Ft. Logic),"[Intro]
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or better known as ADHD, is a mental disorder that affects an individual's ability to focus
Causing them to move around more frequently
They may also have trouble controlling their impulsive behaviors
[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
One time for them prayin' on my downfall (Yeah)
Two times for the homies in the chow hall (Whoa)
Three times for them hoes on the internet
Shittin' on niggas when they really should get out more
Four times for the days that were all bad (Woo!)
Five times for the bitches who ain't called back (Yeah)
Six times for the kids like me who got ADHD just to— (Brap, brap, brap)
[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Kidnap a nigga like ISIS (Whoa)
Turn a whole world to a crisis (Whoa)
Walk around the city with a ice pick
I been paranoid, usually, I ain't like this (Boop, boop)
Ain't no tellin' how crazy I might get, uh (Woo!)
Beat the police with a nightstick (Boop)
In my whole life, I been lifeless
Now I'm so fly, I'm a muhfuckin' flight risk (Woo! Whoa)
Fuck a couple hoes 'til I pass out (Whoa)
Niggas throwin' stones at my glass house (Whoa)
I remember sleepin' on my dad's couch (Whoa)
Now I got the Bentley, and it's blacked out (Whoa)
Family lookin' at me like a cash cow (Whoa)
Errybody dissin' just to have clout (Whoa)
Thought you had a chance, now you assed out
Nigga, I'm the muhfuckin' man, where you at now? (Whoa)
Fuck it, I'ma hit 'em 'til they jumpin'
I ain't trippin', this is nothin' (Brap, brap, brap)
I been livin' in the dungeon
I done held a couple grudges
Went to hell and got abducted
Meet the devil, I'm his cousin
I ain't settlin' for nothin' (Brap, brap, brap)
Got a metal in the truck, I keep a semi when I'm bussin'
Niggas duckin' (Bop)
Even Stevie Wonder could've see it comin' (Brrrap, brap, bop)
I ain't judgin', I just want the money, I don't need a budget
I been hungry, I ain't got no oven (Bop, bop, brrrap, brap)
But I got the munchies, nigga
How you gon' move on the front line? (Woo!)
If I don't fuck with you, I just cut ties (Whoa)
My high school teacher said I'd never be shit
Tell that bitch that I turned out just fine (Joyner)
And no, I don't know you for the twelfth time (Woo!)
We do not share the same bloodline (No)
You love to run your mouth like a tough guy
Hope you keep the same energy when it's crunch time (Woo!)
[Interlude]
According to the American Psychiatric Association
It affects roughly eight percent of children
And two percent of adults
Commonly believed to only affect boys
Because they are perceived as rowdy and rambunctious
[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
One time for them prayin' on my downfall (Yeah)
Two times for them bitches in the South Shore (Whoa)
Three times for them days on the block
Gettin' chased by the cops like a motherfuckin' outlaw
Four times for them days that were all bad (Woo!)
Five times for the bitches who ain't called back (Yeah)
Six times for the kids like me who got ADHD just to— (Brap, brap, brap)
[Verse 2: Logic]
Me and Joyner need a couple hearses (Woo!)
Double homicide, kill the beat and the verses
Everybody livin' on the surface
But we came from the underground, yeah, we deserve it
What's beef?
Beef is when you murder motherfuckers on a beat
Kill 'em all, kill 'em all
Nah, nah, what's beef?
Beef is brothers dyin' over shit
That never mattered in the first place, lyin' in the street
What's peace?
Peace is when you leave it in the past, let it heal like a cast
When enough time pass, then you blast
Kinda like John Wick, bars like a convict
Fuck around and you don't wanna start shit, woo!
Comin' with the hot shit, all they do is talk shit
You could never top it, boy, just stop, stop it
High and drunk, call that HD vision
All these other motherfuckers full of indecision
And I murder with precision all over your television
I'm numero uno, number one and you is just a subdivision
Never listen, we gon' leave them missin'
That's the mission like ISIS (ISIS)
Ain't no time to bicker over who the nicest
It's Logic, it's obvious, just ask the audience
I've come to body this shit (Body this shit)
Yes, it's egregious, I'm Regis
You Kelly, you pussy,
you pussy
Don't push me, I'm Louis Vuitton
You at Target with your mom
On the internet still hatin' on my last post (I hate this nigga)
I just sent a steak back at Mastro's, my god
Me and Joyner need a couple hearses (Woo!)
Double homicide, kill the beat and the verses
Everybody livin' on the surface
But we came from the underground, yeah, we deserve it
Yeah, uh, far from the minimum, killin' 'em with no Ritalin
And 5'9"" was the middleman to get 'em in the same room
Now we on the same tune, and we sealed the game's doom
The illest of lyricists on the same shit
RattPack, clap back on the gang shit
Do it for the love of rap, not for the fame shit, woo![Chorus: Logic]
One time for the Grammy that I never got
Two times for the Garden that I sold out
Three times for the street crimes that I committed
Yeah, I did it, but thank God that I made it out
Four times 'cause I'm a fuckin' bastard
Five times Platinum with my last shit
Six times for the beats and the rhymes
Fuck the heat and the crime
Keep the peace like a waistline, woo!

ISIS, ISIS, ISIS, ISIS, ISIS

Joyner Lucas,I'm Sorry by Joyner Lucas,"[Verse 1]
Go ahead and call me a coward
Say that I'm not strong because I'm not like you
Go ahead and call me crazy
'Cause I live in a maze, tell me how about you?
I think I live in my head
Sometimes I think that I'm dead, I hide behind my youth
Know I been losing my mind
And I'm a little behind, step inside my shoes
'Cause I've never been happy with myself
And I don't need no one feeling bad for me
Tryna to offer me pity and throw jabs at me
Wanna give me advice and then laugh at me
Behind closed doors, just close the door
Let me be by myself—just me and myself
I'm tired of living, I cry
I hear it's easy to die, I wanna see for myself
And I know that sounds crazy to everyone else
But I'm depressed as fuck, stressed as fuck
Ain't no medicine that could cure what's the test as drugs
I mean, I need extra love
And that ain't even enough, said that ain't even enough
And where the fuck is God? (God, God)
Damn, maybe I ain't believing enough
But today, we gonna see if he's real
And if He is, then I guess I'm prolly going to hell
Look, I ain't wanna die like this
I ain't picture my life like this
They don't know what it's like like this
Pretending I'm happy so I can smile like this, and laugh like you
Sometimes I wonder if I ever act like you
Could I finally fit in and maybe relax like, ""Woo!""
Or would you feel lost without me?
'Cause honestly, I think the world is better off without me
And my mind's spinning, this is the line finish
Truth is I don't care how they feel about my feelings
I made up my mind, I'm going out like Robin Williams
I guess I'm not the Ordinary People of John Legend
And I've been suicidal since the day I was nine, shit
Okay, the day I was nine
I've been tired of being bullied, couldn't stay out the fire
Grandma told me I should take it one day at a time
And dammit, look at me now, fuck
Fuck, pen runnin' out, shit, fu—, ugh
Look, just know it's a new day
But if you reading this, then it's prolly too late, blaow!
[Chorus]
Just make sure you tell my family it's okay,
I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
Just make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
[Verse 2]
I hope you got what you wanted
I hope you finally happy, it's too late for you
Been going out of my mind
You don't know how many times that I done prayed for you
I hope you hear me, goddammit
'Cause I got so much shit that I wanna say to you
I used to shine, now I'm all in the dark
I remember I used to tell you to follow your heart
But goddammit, look at you now, it's all of your fault
How could you? Maybe it's my fault
I shoulda paid more attention to what you been doin'
Maybe I should have been more of an influence
I can't believe that you're dead, I fu–
I read your letter and all I could do is have mixed feelings about it
But I'll forever be attached to you (Damn)
Part of me feels bad for you
A part of me feels like you weak and I'm mad at you
And I don't mean to be insensitive
But I don't understand how we couldn't prevent this shit
You took the easy way out, goddammit, you did
I mean, look what you did, I'm so fucking upset
How could you be so selfish?
Nigga, how could you be so selfish?
Now you're gone, you done left me so helpless
I wonder what God thinks, I hope you in God's place behaving yourself
Yo, what the fuck you gotta say for yourself? (Say for yourself)
Look, I really feel lost without you
I hate the fact you think the world is better off without you
And my mind's spinning, this is the line finish
Truth is: I don't care how you feel about my feelings
And I'd be lying to you if I told you I'm fine, listen
I know that you can hear me, all I need is like five minutes
I just wanna reach inside the casket and pull you out
I'm sorry this is something that we both couldn't figure out
I wish I could hear you now, is your soul missing?
I wonder if you could do it again, would you do it different?
Tell me what death is like
Was it meant for you, brodie?
Did the heaven support it?
Are you fucking happy now? Did you get what you wanted?
Isn't this what you wanted? I feel the temperature falling
And you've been suicidal back then you were nine?
Yeah, even back then, you was nine
We was living on the edge, couldn't stay out the fire
Grandma told us we should take it one day at a time
And damn it, look at you now, shit
But it's a new day
And if you can't hear me, it's probably too late, fuck![Chorus]
Just make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry,
so much weighing on me
Just make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
Just make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
Just make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me"
Joyner Lucas,I'm Not Racist by Joyner Lucas,"[Verse 1]
With all due respect
I don't have pity for you black niggas, that's the way I feel
Screamin', ""Black Lives Matter""
All the black guys'd rather be deadbeats than pay your bills
Yellin', ""Nigga,"" this, and, ""Nigga,"" that
Call everybody, ""Nigga,"" and get a nigga mad
As soon as I say, ""Nigga,"" then everyone react
And wanna swing at me and call me racist 'cause I ain't black
Well pound that, then
Talkin' 'bout slavery like you was around back then
Like you was pickin' cotton off the fuckin' ground back then
Like you was on the plantation gettin' down back then
Aight, look
I see a black man aimin' his gun
But I'd rather see a black man claimin' his son
And I don't mean just for one day and you done, I mean
You still trapped in a rut
And I work my ass off and pay my taxes for what?
So you can keep livin' on free government assistance?
Food stamps for your children, but you still tryna sell 'em
For some weed and some liquor or a fuckin' babysitter?
While you party on the road 'cause you ain't got no fuckin' goals?
You already late
You motherfuckers need to get your damn priorities straight, wait
It's like you're proud to be fake
But you lazy as fuck
And you'd rather sell drugs than get a job and be straight
And then you turn around and complain about the poverty rate? Fuck outta my face
You can't escape problems
You can pray for some change, but can't break a dollar
Got nobody else to blame, so you blame Donald
""They fuck the world with a Make America Great condom""
My voice been back
I'm not racist, my sister's boyfriend's black
I'm not racist, my sister-in-law's baby cousin Tracy got a brother and his girlfriend's black
My head's in the cloud
Heard there's not enough jobs for all the men in your house
Maybe we should build a wall to keep the Mexicans out
Or maybe we should send 'em all to the ghetto for now
I'm not racist, and I never lie
But I think there's a disconnect between your culture and mine
I worship the Einsteins, study the Steve Jobs
But you ride 2Pac's dick like he was a fuckin' god, oh my God
And all you care about is rappin' and stuntin' and bein ratchet, and that's the nigga within you
Music rottin' your brain and slowly start to convince you
Then you let your kids listen and then the cycle continues
Blame it all on the menu, blame it on those drinks
Blame it on everybody except for your own race
Blame it on white privileges, blame it on white kids
And just blame it on white citizens, aim at the vice president
Bunch of class clowns
Niggas kneelin' on the field, that's a flag down
How dare you try to make demands for this money?
You gon' show us some respect, you gon' stand for this country,
nigger
I'm not racist, I'm just prepared for this type of war
I heard Eminem's rap at the awards, who's he fightin' for?
Y'all can take that motherfucker too, he ain't white no more
It's like you wanna be so famous
You'll do anything for attention and a little payment
I can't take you nowhere without people pointin' fingers
Pants hangin' off your ass, you ain't got no home trainin'?
Pull your fuckin' pants up, nigga
Put that suit back on, take that durag off
Take that gold out your mouth, quit the pitiful stuff
And then maybe police'd stop killin' you fucks, yo, what the fuck?
I'm not racist
It's like we're livin' in the same building, but split into two floors
I'm not racist
But there's two sides to every story, I wish that I knew yours
I wish that I knew yours
I'm not racist, I swear
[Verse 2]
With all disrespect
I don't really like you white motherfuckers, that's just where I'm at
Screaming, ""All Lives Matter,"" is a protest to my protest, what kind of shit is that?
And that's one war you'll never win
The power in the word, ""Nigga,"" is a different sin
We shouldn't say it, but we do, and that's just what it is
But that don't mean that you can say it just 'cause you got nigga friends
Nigga
That word was originated for you to keep us under
And when we use it, we know that's just how we greet each other
And when you use it, we know there's a double meaning under
And even if I wasn't picking cotton physically
That don't mean I'm not affected by the history
My grandmama was a slave, that shit gets to me
And you ain't got no motherfuckin' sympathy, you pussy nigga
I'm sorry, you can never feel my life
Tryna have faith, but I never felt alright
It's hard to elevate when this country's ran by whites
Judging me by my skin color and my blackness
Tryna find a job but ain't nobody call me back yet
Now I gotta sell drugs to put food in my cabinet
You crackers ain't slick, this is all a part of your tactics
Don't talk about no motherfuckin' taxes
When I ain't making no dough
You think you know everything, but you don't
You wanna copy our slang and everything that we know
Try to steal black culture and then make it your own, woah
Fuck, I'm exhausted
I can't even drive without the cops tryna start shit
I'm tired of the systematic racism bullshit
All you do is false shit, this the shit that I'm forced with
And you don't know shit about my people, that's what bothers you
You don't know about no fried chicken or no barbecue
You don't know about the two-step or no loose change
You don't know about no 2 Chainz or no Kool-Aid, you don't know
And even though Barack was half as black
You hated President Obama, I know that's a fact
You couldn't wait to get him out and put a cracker back
And then you gave us Donald Trump and now it's payback for that
I'm not racist, I never lied
But I know there's a disconnect between your culture and mines
Yeah, I praise 2Pac like he was a fuckin' god
He was fighting for his life way before he fuckin' died, nigga, die, nigga
And all you care about is money and power and being ugly and that's the cracker within you
Hatred all in your brain, it slowly start to convince you
And then you teach it to your children until the cycle continue
Blame it on Puerto Rico, blame it on OJ
Blame it on everybody except for your own race
Blame it on black niggas and blame it on black citizens
Aim at the black businesses, I ain't saying I'm innocent, but
I might be any day now
Treatin' everybody how you want and any way how
I swear North Korea 'bout to bomb us any day now
And now I'm duckin' every time I hear a fuckin' plane now, shit
You know I make a lot of sense, but you just can't admit it
When Eminem went against Trump, that was the illest
'Cause even though he's white, he let us know he standin' with us
I'm not racist, but I cry a lot
You don't know what it's like to be in a frying pot
You don't know what it's like to mind your business
And get stopped by the cops and not know if you 'bout to die or not
You worry 'bout your life, so you take mine
I love you, but I fuckin' hate you at the same time
I wish we could trade shoes or we could change lives
So we could understand each other more, but that'd take time
I'm not racist
It's like we livin' in the same building, but split into both sides
I'm not racist
But there's two sides to every story and now you know mine[Outro]
Can't erase the scars with a bandage
I'm hopin' maybe we can come to an understandin'
Agree to disagree, we could have an understandin'
I'm not racist"

Killin' 'em in the ambulance, they dyin', they bleedin', they tremblin'

What you utter? Stop stutterin', what you spend? Let me double it
Lime green 'Rari, two twins, call 'em double mints
If all you pussy niggas my kids, I'm in trouble then
Shut up 'fore I spank you for actin' up
Now I'm wakin' up in cabanas 'cause she bad as fuck
And all gorillas don't want bananas 'less your chain is tucked
You wiggity-wack with the strap, you cross Chris, make you jump
I criss-cross with the pump, ain't no bricks in the trunk
Leave that shit for the chumps, I still get what I want
Don't wanna believe in my mind, but you believe in my dump
I'm takin' a knee for my side, could give a fuck 'bout the owners
Nigga look at my eyes, you 'bout to give me my bonus
And every motherfuckin' record, that's a hit, I record it (Celebrate)
And e'ry motherfuckin' snitch up in this bitch, they report it (Celebrate)
You paid your way for this fade and can't even afford it
75 mil', look at me now (Celebrate)
And all these bad bitches can't keep their feet down (Elevate)
You don't really wanna see Brown
Need to stop all that shit talkin', put the seat down
Joyner, I don't really feel these niggas
Hol' up, I ain't gotta pay to kill these niggas
Time is money, need to fuck around and bill these niggas
Vet, so I'm finna good will these niggas (Celebrate)
(Buck, buck, buck)
I'ma kill these niggas, I should grill these niggas
Take flex, Fresh Prince, Uncle Phil these niggas
(Brap, brap, brap)
Oh shit, I'm the shit, you could smell me, nigga
Break ribs, yeah, you don't want no real beef, nigga
I say As-salāmu ʿalaykum when I tear apart some bacon
Ho, you actin' like a pig, you fuckin' filthy, nigga
(Woo, woo, woo!)
Now the police tryna lock me in the prison, said, ""I'm guilty""
I said, ""Da da da da da, come and kill me, nigga"" (Buck)[Verse 4: Joyner Lucas, Chris Brown &
Both
]
They must have forgot that I'm psycho (Jheeze)
Oh, you want war? Say no more
Turn your fuckin' block into a light show
(Joyner)
You better be sure, better be sure
I'm the realest nigga that I know (Hey)
And I'm so bored, I might switch cars
I saved a lotta money on Geico
(Jheeze)
The neighbors knockin' on my door, what the fuck you want?
Bitch, I'm alright
(Jheeze)
Listen, nigga, mind your business, I'm so sick of niggas
Tellin' me how I been livin' my life
(Joyner)
Sick of bumpin' shoulders, now I'm runnin' over
Every motherfucker who ain't wanna get in my ride
(Buck, buck, buck, woo!)
I was watchin', you was shoppin'
Ain't never had the shit in my size
(Jheeze)
Now I'm poppin', I'm poppin'
And your bitch keep hittin' my line
It's complicated, fuckin' up with my main bitch
Givin' it to the side bitch at the same damn time
Puttin' my face in it, never wastin' it
I'ma lay in it, hit it, hit it one more time
And I'ma proceed and play with the pussy
You know I don't keep my cape on a hoodie
But I keep a Uzi, it's a doozie, make a movie if you're actin' stupid
So (Celebrate)"
Joyner Lucas,Bank Account (Remix) by Joyner Lucas,"[Chorus]
I'm willing to die for this shit
I'm ready to flip it and end up in prison the rest of my life for this shit
So my momma ain't want me, she got an abortion
I end up surviving this shit
And if I wanted somethin', I ain't got the money
I'd probably be robbing and shit
Don't know how much I cry for this shit
Said I am willing to ride for this shit
You know murder's my hobby, inside of my closet's a bunch of dead bodies and shit
Niggas say that I'm cursed 'cause I go to church and stare at the Bible and shit
Shawty say I'm the worst cause I do my dirt, and I don't be hiding this shit
[Verse]
Bitch, I'm a savage I spit at you bastards, I wonder what you gonna do to me, ho
I need to hear some more rapping
I'm just not impressed by your cash or your jewelry, ho
All you my soldiers and I'm a lieutenant
Goddammit, you should be saluting me, ho
I hope you know I ain't going nowhere
All you rappers just better get used to me, ho
Nigga, I'm
Mr. Blue
with my jeans, bought me a Jeep, 'cause I wasn't riding as much
My bank account looking weak, don't look at me, I ain't got time for no fun
Starting to feel like Tyrese, I'm 'bout to trip, and maybe start crying or som'
I might just hit up the Smith's, throw me a fit and wait for my wire to come
Ain't nobody give or show me love when I was coming up, I had to double up and tell these niggas buckle up before they ride
And they don't really wanna knuckle up, I hit 'em with the uppercut, I had these motherfuckers running for they life
Unidentified craft when I'm flying past, I'm an alien sailin' and if you look up in the sky
Blow your mind back, put your eyes back to your iPad, I'm an Iraqi in suicide
When the bombs are loaded and your mind explode in the wind
And you gon' sit down, repent
I was raised in the sewer; me and the 𝘐𝘵 clown are friends
Red balloons for your kids, sink my tooth in ya bitch
I lost too many friends, I don't do good with kids
What you know about riding dirty in the evening?
What you know about Ramen Noodles, and a pack of sazon seasoning
What you know about leaving the oven door open when there's no heat again
And the rent is due and your landlord try and throw you out on the streets again
Nigga, I was always dreaming of a Bentley and a fucking Lamborghini when I win 'em, I'ma finally get a break
If I didn't get it way before, I guarantee that if I talk to God, then I can say I got it when I prayed
She don't really want me to get petty,
turn a dime into a penny
, but she know I got a lot of shit to say
I can turn some water into Henny, drink it up and let the semi shoot, I'll pop you niggas all up in the face
Blood all up in the lake, I
Wanna see your wake die
They don't wanna wave bye
Creep when I came by, teeth like a canine
Bleed through your Levi, we from the East Side
Eat when the
beat's hot, tea from the teapot
Aim for the tree top, beg till your knees pop
Skrrt in a Nissan, swerve into three cars
You just a bird in a beehive, you just a cold in a room full of germs
Nigga, I said all of my idols and favorite rappers ain't been rhyming a lot
What the fuck happened to Jay Electronica? I wonder if he still got it or not
What ever happened to eLZhi?
What ever happened to Meth?
What happened to Beans?
What ever happened to Lauryn?
What happened to Banks?
Tell me what happened to Bleek?
What the fuck happened to Mos?
What happened to Missy?
Nigga, what happened to Ghost?
What ever happened to Cube?
What up with Common?
What the fuck, where did they go?
Tell me what happened to Budden's,
what about Luda?
I hope they ain't losing it now
Hope they get back to the music 'cause I need some new shit
I'm sick of these new niggas out, I'm that new nigga now
[Bridge]
I got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
Nine niggas wanna war, 10 niggas on the floor, 11 niggas on the porch
12 killers wanna war, 13 carnivores, 14 Labradors, 15 dinosaurs, 16 Avatars
17 bombs or grenades at your rental car, 18 ways you can die when you have it all
I got I got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
Nine bitches wanna fuck, 10 niggas wanna rush, 11 hitters on a bus
12 think they one of us, 13 other guns, 14 runners-up, 15 rubber gloves, 16 double pumps
17 shots in your face till you cuddle up, 18 ways you can die tryna fuck with us
[Chorus]
I'm willing to die for this shit
Said I'm ready to flip it and end up in prison the rest of my life for this shit
And my momma ain't want me, she got an abortion
I end up surviving this shit
Shit if I wanted somethin', I ain't got the money
I'll probably be robbing this shit
Don't know how much I cry for this shit
Said I am willing to die for this shit
You know murder's my hobby, inside of my closet's a bunch of dead bodies and shit

Joyner Lucas,Devil's Work by Joyner Lucas,"[Intro]
Father, forgive me
[Verse]
I'm staring at this Bible as I keep glancing
Dear Lord, I got questions and I need answers
Tryna understand your vision, all I see is damage
Just a bunch of dead bodies in the street camping
A bunch of lost souls on their feet standing
We supposed to be your children, I thought we family
You're supposed to be my Father, bruh, I need answers
We don't need to die young, we just need chances
Tired of living on the edge so we keep scrambling
Tryna talk to these strippers but they keep dancing
We just wanna be number one like Steve Francis
Bow our heads, say a prayer, now the seed's planted
Everywhere I turn, I'm seeing MC's vanish
Lot of good niggas gone, I don't understand it
Lot of families lost and they sea stranded
I ain't tryna disrespect you, I just need answers
I know you're watching us from heaven thinking, ""Who to save?""
Cherry pickin' who should go next and who should stay
I'd be on my way to heaven if I knew the way
And bring back every good nigga you choose to take
They say you never wrong, but you done made a few mistakes
'Cause you taking the wrong niggas, maybe you should trade
Trade us back all the real ones, remove the fakes
I think you should trade
Give us 2Pac back, and take that nigga Suge (Ooh!)
Let the legend resurrect and he gon' live for good (Ooh!)
I been screaming ""Thug life"" in every different hood (Thug life, thug life)
If only you could bring him back, Lord, I wish you would
Give us Biggie, give us Pun, give us Triple X
Take that nigga Trump with you, that's a bigger threat
There's too much power for a coward with no intellect
That's a bigot with a collar, there's a disconnect
Niggas dying, Mama crying, Grandma need a tissue
Niggas shootin' up a church, now I need a pistol
All them niggas still livin', you don't see the issue
But how you take Selena and then you take Aaliyah with you?
I ain't tryna disrespect, just need to meet up with you (Lord)
I ain't tryna overstep, just want to reason with you (Lord)
Give us back our loved ones and take the evil with you (Lord)
Send them suckers straight to hell, they don't need a vigil (Woo!)
I need you to give us back Martin Luther, take Martin Shkreli (Take!)
Give us back Malcolm, take R. Kelly
R.I.P. Lil Snupe, give that boy his life back
Take Eric Holder, give us Eric Wright back
I'm sending you this message, Lord, I hope you hit me right back
They say I'm on the wrong train, I know I'm on the right track
(Yeah)
'Cause Trayvon gone, and all he did was try to fight back
Zimmerman walk around free, we don't like that (We don't like that)
Why you take our mothers from us?
Our fathers and our sisters and our cousins from us?
Got these children getting murdered while they double dutchin'
Wonder why the fuck you take Nipsey Hussle from us?
Damn, you took a true king, a true brother from us
This a fuckin' marathon, but they runnin' from us
Now everybody got guns, niggas up to something
And every gangsta wanna prove that they tough or something
You know it's not fair, tell the truth, I've been in my feelings too
But if you took Emmett Till, at least take Dylann Roof
At least take James Holmes, I ain't even mad at that
Just bring back Whitney, and give us Michael Jackson back
Feds want me in the slammer, damn
Ain't no justice for Sandra Bland, we up like the ceiling fan
Lord, if you listenin', I'm just lookin' for a hand to hand
Take out the fuck niggas and give us back our fam again
Drownin' in my tears, tryna pray for something (Woo!)
Wonder why you give us life for you to take it from us (Woo!)
Wonder why you give us family then erase them from us (Woo!)
Maybe hopefully you can have a conversation with us (Yeah)
Maybe I'm just probably tripping 'cause I need a hug (I need a hug)
The hood can't find jobs, now we need a plug (We need a plug)
Everybody and their mama tryna be a thug
I don't go to church 'cause I'm afraid of being judged
I've been starin' at the ceiling as I lie in bed
Watchin' niggas follow trends like Simon Says (Yeah)
I pray you give us back the real ones and try again
Or maybe take them niggas that deserve to die instead
Tomi Lahren run her mouth and then she get defensive
Laura Ingraham laughin' at death and disrespectin'
I really feel like you should teach them stupid hoes a lesson
Either that or give us back somebody who deserve the blessings
I left out a bunch of names that I forgot to mention
Cost too much to pay attention, then it got expensive
Father forgive me, for I know not what I do
And now I'm reachin' out to you, hopin' you hear me and return the message (Joyner)
I know that you got our back and that you're not against us
Or maybe you just love us so you doin' shit to test us
I just kinda thought that you would do more to protect us
They say that the good die young and I ain't on the guest list
I've been drinkin', Lord forgive me, it's my blood racin'
I don't know what I'm thinking, I'm just frustrated
I don't mean to question you, I'm just confused
I don't know what else to do, I've been patient and it sucks waiting
Took my mans from me, that forever hurts
But puttin' the blame on you, that'd never work
I know this ain't your fault, it's the devil's work
Devil's work"

Joyner, Joyner, Joyner
Sober minds
Dead silence
Yuh, listen, look
[Chorus]
I don't take no fucking percocets
Molly, Percocets
No ecstasy, promethazine
No lean, no purple mess
No dirty Sprite but bitch, I got that Kyrie Irving step
If you don't think that I'm the shit, it's just cause you ain't heard me yet
I'm 'bout to put my mask on, my mask on
Stick all these industry niggas up until they cash gone
I know you high for the moment but that shit don't last long
I know you wasn't expecting this shit but you asked for it
[Verse]
I'm about to grab niggas by the throat
I'm about to crash Lil Yachty boat
I'm about to drag niggas by the coat
Take out your trash, sit it by the door
Shit, I got the mask on me, I'm 'bout to go
I hate when niggas act funny when I'm alone
And try to give daps to me and tip their hats to me
And they act gully when they at home
Yeah, I don't do Xannies or Mollys
Don't come near me with problems
And don't you compare me to Logic (never)
Go listen to Sriracha
Yeah, that's Amanda to Ronda
And that's a Benz to a Honda
Yeah, that's a dance with the devil
And I ain't dancing behind ya
My nigga, I'm a muthafucking entity
You don't get it, even landlords gotta pay rent to me
Gingerbread man fuckers ain't catchin' me
Sick and tired of niggas sickening, depressing me
Go to church, I testify
Pray to God I bless the beat
Kanye said ""Touch the Sky""
Future might come for me
But I'm a fucking beast and if I die, that sucks for me
But where the crown I'ma kill the king
I bet a lot of haters won't feel the same
I dug the ground, I built the ring
I cut the cow I milked the game, nigga
I should cut a hole in the sky
Make you feel the rain, nigga feel the pain, nigga
A lot of rap niggas get nervous when they hear my name, nigga
I'm insane, nigga
Back when you was watching Leave It To Beaver
I was crushing on Tila Tequila
I was swagging in Adidas and Filas
Fuckin' divas call 'em
Venus, Serena
Signed my deal and told em Cesar's a beater
Hope you didn't think I needed you neither
Take it back and told 'em I didn't mean it
'Cause my uncle said it's cheaper to keep it[Refrain]
Mask off, run in the back door
Blast y'all hats off
Fuck is you mad for?
I catch y'all, smash y'all
Don't mean to laugh hard

You think you comin' for me but you never could last long
You don't mean nothin' to me

And be afraid to get it poppin', now they duckin' and dippin', I mean
What's up with you mumble niggas that never say nothin'?
I'm about to make all of you fuckers go to bed in the oven
I go to sleep with the devil and wake up next to your mother
And you ain't telling me nothing
I mean I'm very disgustin'
I mean I'm ready to bust and
Put an end to you fucker, now what's what?
How many CDs could a woodchuck chuck
If he chucked it at every single nigga that sucked?
Huh?[Bridge]
Look, all you a lie
I don't cuff no hoes, you can have my bitch
I don't even mind
It seems like all these hoes wanna do is switch up
They rather be a guy
If she could suck my dick everyday for a living
Then that'd be her job, yuh
I said candy paint in yo fuckin' rims
.38 in yo fuckin' Benz
I was broke as fuck had a couple friends
A refrigerator and a cup of gin
Let's drink it up, me and you
'Cause these niggas fake, and I see it too
And they try to get me to pop Percocets and Molly
And I said

I don't take no fucking percocets

Give me a pen
I don't even drink, but fuck it, I need some Henny and gin
Plenty of sins
I broke my bitch's heart, she'll never forgive me again
Where have you been?
I had to go find myself, I killed and buried my friends
I never could swim
I used to push some weight with niggas who been in the gym
Come step in my Timbs
You could not walk my path
I never caught my cabs, I had to walk
Niggas was lost and sad, I never would call my dad
Fuck that nigga
I was depressed as fuck, mentally torn in half
Feelin' stuck
When it was hard to laugh, the music was all I had
Wish I could be out
I never got any clout, what's all the plottin' about?
They drownin' me out
Everyone countin' me out, nobody try to reach out
You proud of me now?
Niggas'll flip the script, I cannot live to quit
I don't wanna chill, I don't wanna get no flicks
Don't wanna rekindle shit
It's N-O-T, don't you flex on me
I do not get no sleep
I'm barely up, hope you ante up

The older the berry, the sweeter the juice
Knew I could do it, I needed the proof
In order to lose, I needed to win
In order to win, I needed to choose
I needed to fall, I needed to move

I'm coming for everything they said I couldn't
Including your plate and all of your food
I don't wanna do no E
Don't wanna drink, I don't wanna do no lean
I don't wanna move no keys
How you like me now? I'm too OG
I feel like Kool Moe Dee
Ain't gon' be no slatt, my whole team'll crack
I seen 'em flat, never seen no snacks, they left me the scraps
I Deebo'd that
Think I'm cursed again, went to church to sin
I did a lot
Mama quit her job, she won't work again
I been on top
Got a mental block and it hurts, but then I bid and shop
And my bitch is fly, she a perfect ten
That's M-O-B, don't you flex on me, I do not get no sleep
I'm problematic and I gotta have it, word to Ed OG
You don't know me, I need my revenge, no more peace
I'm rollin' deep and I'm finna turn your block up into World War III[Chorus]
I roll up on 'em while he sleep (Hey), you gon' see
It's a fuckin' murder spree (Brrat, bah), you gon' see
Won't nobody say a peep (Bah, bah), you gon' see
Don't you turn your back on me (Brrat, bah), you gon' see
Roll up on 'em while he sleep (Doo), catch a nigga slippin'
I might hit him with the (Bah, bah-bah, bah-bah), they gon' miss him
'Cause revenge feels sweet (Woo), you gon' see
Won't nobody say a peep (Bah, bah), you gon' see"

Used to dream about gettin' it, now I got it, I don't drive
I had a spot like The Varsity, what'll you have?
You buy twenty, I'll front what you buy
I put on drip, I believe I can I fly
Niggas know that I'm rich, but they know not to try
I had a show in Detroit and I stopped at Revive
And spent fifty on all of the guys
All of these hoes in these stores make commission
And plus I'ma tip 'em, they holdin' my size
Get in your car and just put on your flashers
And follow the hearse since you say you gon' ride
'Cause somebody gon' die if they fuck with us
Turn a five to a dime, that's a double up
Fuck around, walk through church with my double cup
This shit a habit, I'm prayin' I give it up
Tiger stay with the wood, make 'em give it up
Know I ran through a mil' every week coppin' weed
Bruh beat the charge, I can get me some sleep
Got a backend to pick up, I won't even leave
Run it up, fuck around, give the 'Vette to DT
Keep a hotboy with me, I got love for BG
Chasin' this paper since twelve or thirteen
Runnin' 'round in these streets, it was me and Marquise[Chorus: 42 Dugg & Lil Baby]

Turned his back, must've felt let down
Heard I'm down seven hundred, what you gon' bet now?
Yeah, I used to be a twerp, bitch, a vet now
Luke, get up, doggy, I need you
Only nigga made sure that I was eatin'
Free Nef still, nigga, RIP Reese
Get her nails done, still charge for the feature
Baby, we ain't that, nah, we ain't this
All that fuckin', I don't do no kissin'
Bitches ain't shit, word to my niggas
All in my mentions (Damn)

Tell the lil' hoes I'm Bryson

Get popped, nigga, I ain't doin' no fightin'
Sinnin' 'bout cash, I ain't doin' no right

Car too fast, can't stop at no light
I hit the gas, it skrrt, then I pull off
I'm on they ass, I just took a year off
She shakin' her ass, call me when she get off
Took half a mil' for my lil' bro to get out
That new Richard Mille made me feel like a boss
Feel like I'm Meech when I'm ridin' in these cars
Who you know pull up whole entourage in a foreign?
I got designer for days, but it's somethin' about 'em
Go crazy for white Air Force 1's, maybe 'cause I'm a dope boy
He be loud, but he ain't makin' no noise
'Ventador on the ground like a skateboard
If I want it, I get it, I pay for it
I pay extra, I ain't tryna wait for it
Everything that I got, it was made for me
I was servin' them trap houses faithfully
Everybody with me gotta eat
Say your grace with me
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Thou shall not try one of us, if they do, I'ma bust
Please don't reach for no chain
Not 'bout the set, but it's more 'bout respect
If they get me upset, they gon' die, that's on gang
Ran up my check, when I walk in the bank
They greet me at the door by my government name
I made a promise, I'm never gon' change
Rolls-Royce umbrella, I'm hopin' it rain, yeah[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
Right back on it, designer my garments
Corner store mornings, there until the sun down
I don't trust no one, I can't put my gun down
Goin' number one now, hottest out, hands down
Bands out, pants down, yeah, I'm thuggin'
I done got rich, everybody my cousin
You ain't servin' no packs with me, you ain't my brother
That chopper go through shit, I call it the cutter
I just bought a new whip, I went bought another
My mother, she happy now
Ain't no cap and gown, but I graduated
Her house paid for, and that new Mercedes
Know you see that they been tryna be me lately
I'm a heavy hitter like Gervonta Davis
That shit ain't gon' save 'em, leave 'em on the pavement
All I know is get this motherfuckin' paper

Thou shall not try one of us, if they do, I'ma bust

Fucked a nigga's ho, so he say he wanna kill me
I miss Tev, this shit was different
I miss Nef, rest in peace to my niggas
Damn near went deaf, when they told me they killed you
Turn rat? Nigga, fuck on
Thirteen thou' VVS buffs on
Still'll flood a nigga town with a truckload
Get the head, I'm out, I don't trust hoes
If the feds in the house, a nigga told on me

G5 just beat his murder
Body got picked up, doggy I'm hurt
Still pay the lawyer even though I'm nervous

I can't wait for the nights with you

[Verse 1: 42 Dugg & Scorpions]
Ain't nothin' plain on me, nigga, four chains on me (I just want to be loved by you)
I ain't trippin' 'bout that ho, nigga, she came on me
I got a bitch from the West, she'll suck a nigga soft
Bitch from the East, she'll fuck a nigga dawgs (No one like—)
Still playin' with that raw even though I got a deal
Had to get up out the city, I just got a nigga killed
Pause, I'm lyin', kinda, still sippin' out the Fanta
OxyContin and Opanas, I want four-two for each
Niggas upped Lou for free, that's my nigga, come and kick it
Mister still'll serve the city, I'm the reason it's some chicken
Why the fuck you in the kitchen tryna turn one?
Daire quit pullin' on thе blender 'fore you burn somе
Baby say she want a real nigga, but she don't get it
Why you ain't never up at night? I told you I been sippin'
Still go harder for my niggas, wish I could bring you back
Turntest in the city, white lows, blue flags
Know I keep two flags on bang
I just dropped a Urus for the gang
Catch me in the city, young nigga, four chains
Signed to CMG, still in the dope game
I don't swipe propane, really got it out the mud
Big 4 Gang, catch me ridin' with the thugs
And I got it on my own, ain't nobody helped me
Remain humble, sell crack to dope fiends
You can't ""Lil' bro"" me, bitch, I really got a check
42 in this shit, I be really on that
Put the city on my back, still remember hard times
2018 was the year my dawg died

Pull up in frog eyes, yeah nigga, we winning
Amiris on low, if not, wheat Timbs
Me and 42 pullin' up, twin Bentleys

Know I keep two flags on bang
I just dropped a Urus for the gang
Tied from the D to LA
Always keep it a hunnid K
[Verse 2: Roddy Ricch]
Number one nigga, but they're never gon' admit it
I was doin' two-hundred in the 'Rari and got a ticket
Every time they see me, they say they ain't seen me in a minute
Probably fuckin' on your bitches, probably runnin' up the digits
Forgiato wheels, both lanes
Floor mats say a nigga name
Interrogation, feds tried to put us on the board, never identified
All my niggas always gettin' dough, it's always chicken time
I got niggas in the box, gon' call me collect
I got model bitches that be tryna call me for sex
And you know what they say, ""If it ain't directed, then don't respect it""
You see 'em out in public, they gon' act like they never said it
I see by the C-side, I throw it up two times
And your nigga got a gangster card, he bought it off Groupon
One of the young niggas that be gettin' love in the city
From the hub to the dub in the tub, fuck with me[Chorus: 42 Dugg & Roddy Ricch]
Pull up in frog eyes, yeah nigga, we winning
Amiris on low, if not, wheat Timbs

Pour a lotta dope in my soda

Yeah, yeah
[Chorus: 42 Dugg]
Bad bitch from the hood, she ratchet
New Glock on my hip, this plastic
I just bought a new whip, five fifty M6
Threw my fingers up, then I'm smashing
Bitch, I'm a thug nigga, ho, I'm not a rapper
Run up with the plug, whole hood got the backend
[Verse 1: Lil Baby & 42 Dugg]
Broke out the Rolls truck, Baby, what we ridin' in?
Rolls truck parked in the hood, don't drive it
Next one I catch slick dissin', we gon' slide 'em
Catch a bad bitch with a nigga still DMin'
Turned to a rat, it don't matter, I don't be with him
Dugg says, ""It's up,"" then I'm flyin' to the D with him
Corvette or two-seater, how you got three wit 'em?
Middle of the projects, don't mess three with 'em
Run it through the sack, back, I guess I'ma run it back
I'm goin' for the touchdown, we caught us a flea flicker
When I slide some tints on the low-key vehicle
[Verse 2: 42 Dugg]
Niggas really bitches on whatever I'm feelin'
Next nigga mention my name, I'll kill him
And y'all ain't the same, I'm different
I hit his man, he trippin'
Nigga, fuck these bitches, nah, fuck y'all niggas
Hit my nigga Baby for the G behind the PM
Five outta nine, I done hit a nigga BM
I bet whatever on the team, fuck a re-up
These niggas hoes, half of 'em wanna be us
Pull his bitch right in his face, that be us

Bad bitch from the hood, she ratchet
Rightchea is two point five on the mattress

Lil' rappin' ass nigga better pay they taxes
Shit been high, it's dry, cactus
Say four and half, anytime, I don't fraction
Nigga, I got plaques, I'm trappin'
Pocket full of blues, got 'em on Nip
Plug come from Houston, got him on Flip
Gun from Atlanta, ridin’ like Tip
New FN right on the hip[Chorus: 42 Dugg]
Bad bitch from the hood, she ratchet
New Glock on my hip, this plastic
I just bought a new whip, five fifty M6

Run up with the plug, whole hood got the backend
Bad bitch from the hood, she ratchet

Homie outside with Alicia Keys
I make money from mics, they make money from fiends (Yeah)
Root of all evil, what got me them tickets at Regal
So fuck what's illegal
I'm different, I really ain't get a handout
I know half of these rappers were gimmicks (On gang)
I write my own lyrics, I bought my own pen
All them O's buy my songs, screamin' ""Fuck your opinion""
No need for a nigga to say that I'm winnin'
It's fuck everybody, the way I been feelin'
I got me a bitch and my bitch got a bitch (On God, on God)

I could ask a partner in my camp to handle somethin'
They just do it like they beefin' with Adidas (Yeah)
Bitches poppin' pussy for the same skinny nigga droppin' music
Ain't nobody have believe it (Yeah)
Took a couple Ls, I ain't tweakin'
I got money to help all my reasons (Yeah)
I got shorties from all major regions
I jumped in the water and claimin' the deep end (Hold on)
Different money I'm countin' those shorties I'm poundin' on
I know them niggas is pissed
I'ma put a new Patek on by my bitch silicone
Then I'ma double again
Niggas ain't solid, I don't claim a friend
Because when I was knockin', you ain't let me in
Niggas lose vision all over the pussy
Respect the whole gang 'fore a blue Benjamin
Witness everyone say that I'm up
I was stuck at the bottom, you ain't give a fuck
I don't care for a bitch, I ain't searchin' for love
And I ain't trust a soul if he ain't from above
I ain't surfin' the wave, I got lost, fuck a brush
When I got in the game, I was shit out of luck
They would look at my pain and they ain't help me up
If you mention my name, say, ""I don't give a fuck"" (Bitch)[Chorus]

Hotter than a sauna
I got more bucks, got more white than a bitch named Madonna
Lil' nigga, come check my status
Mike ain't never been average, I make it happen
Give me a bag, I'ma pack it
When I get mad, my chain get pissed
When I get sad, my ears shed tears
Been in the game three years
It's takin' a while 'cause' I'm pure
I'm better than them, I'm sick, no cure
Bonafide niggas don't have no fear
Rick Ross, my pants make me look like a pear
Madе two bands up in two minutes
My music make money slidе
When I leave, make bitches go suicide
When I got in the game, I got crucified
I ain't take no handouts, nigga
Why you got your hand out, nigga?
I'm flyer than any bird of a feather
You focused on bitches? Bruh, get it together
She tryna crease these lemon pepper steppers (Uh-uh)
Almost put the ho on a strecher (Uh-huh)
Got five missed calls, won't text her (Uh-uh)
Lil' shawty always been extra (Uh-huh)
This all-wheel drive, no Tesla (No Tesla)
I run this game, come catch up
Step on somethin' apply that pressure
Niggas mad, but I can't help 'em
[Chorus]
I'ma just tell my story
This DLOG, no man above me

All I do is chase the glory
Me and fye like Rick and Morty

These niggas be pocket watchin'
Can't say shit, 'cause I'm twenty in the 2020 (Vroom)
Movin' work in that Challenger (Challenger)
While your bitch givin' brain from the passenger (The passenger)
Niggas can't keep up with me unless I let 'em
He gon' trust that bitch unless I tell him
Promise your homie is not your real homie
You think that's your homie? Then go 'head and test him (On God)
Take her on a trip (Trip), put it on her lip (Her lip)
Watch how young niggas get drip
I got some baby mamas tryna strip (On gang)
I got some young niggas tryna clip (On gang)
Thought we was homies, now you below me
It's funny that pussy can make niggas phony
It's funny that money can make niggas ho me, hold on (What you say to 'em, though?)
But like I said, Double Lamb OG
All my niggas got beats, they eat
Yeah, Mike Dimes don't do no feats
Before one time, I slide G3
Yeah, my whip don't got no keys
Yeah, my bitch don't got no weave
All my niggas throw up L
But this no loss, this shit low-key
I get back, I get it back
I get a bag, I get a backend
I won't trip, 'cause I'm never lackin'
I get a brick and make it a fraction
I get it lit, I make it lit
I get it lit, I get it litty
Ain't no mark gon' have me slippin'
But this Glock gon' turn you to Ricky, that's on God
These niggas be fraud, these niggas don't rob
These niggas be talkin' 'bout all that cap (On gang)
These niggas be timid, these niggas ain't with it
I send him the addy, he gone off the map
I come through quick, come through quick
The minute you drops, make fiends relapse
This Glock my fan, this bitch gon' clap
I feel like NAV, I'ma tap, tap, tap[Chorus]
I'ma just tell my story
This DLOG, no man above me

I was fuckin' broads before I was in my prime, nigga
Been the shit since I lеft my daddy's nuts
We pullin' caddies up for any nigga that be actin' tough
I nеver bragged enough, a city boy, I'm always actin' up
I'm takin' all her stuff, the nails, to weed
Designer bags and such, I know I been a klutz
Flow smoother than the slave ships, pay for writin' scripts
I'm like a bible that can move your hips, the land of holy shit
I say one thing, it start apocalypse, I like to give her tip
Don't fuck with niggas 'cause they all gon' flip, I never trip
'Cause niggas never really liked me
Point at anybody, bet they all would try to fight me
Prolly 'cause I left him or his bitch was getting pipe, B

Leave me alone, why every sentence start with ""My G""?

Niggas talkin' shit but they ain't bringin' it to the table
Bitch, I'm tryna get this money, fuck a motherfuckin' label
I got children everywhere, I rock you niggas in the cradle
I ain't kiddin' with you niggas, I ain't motherfuckin' playful
Young nigga twenty, I'm tryna hit twenty mill'
And I'm eatin' good, I did had about twenty meals
Big body motor, see no big body wheels
This the H-Town drip, candy paint and golden grills
Bitch, I got the Tee with a little lemon squeeze
Bitch, I'm for the streets, I fuck a new bitch every week
Nigga, disrespect and you'll be drumming up a beat

2017, I told the teacher, ""Who as hot as me?"" (Who as hot as me?)
One year later, now I got a teacher tryna top on me (Tryna top on me)
That's your favorite rapper? Why the hell is he a mockery?
You say, ""We compatible,"" I see you like mythology (Freaky)
Bitch, I'm too expensive, this ain't normal wood, this dick mahogany (Huh?)
I'm a prophecy, I'm kickin' shit, a solo soccer tеam (Hello)
Where's Billiе Jean? I'm tryna see if she can rock with me (Rock with me)
If you blonde, I give you semen, you can taste my colony (Uh)
And I'm too official, if you speak to me, address me properly
My small biography enough to cure your curiosity
I don't need your help and I don't care about apologies
I drop a song and make enough to buy a couple properties (Huh?)
Yeah, I spent that, money, yeah, I get that (Get that)
I don't like to chit-chat (Chit-chat), I like makin' big racks (Big racks)
Little nigga big mad, you can have your bitch back
Couple months ago and I was stressin', now I remember

They said, ""Who are you?"" and started laughin' (Huh?) I ain't embarrassed (Man, what the fuck?)

Bitch, go to hell (That's how you feelin?), that's how I'm rockin'
They ain't wanna show no love to the boy (On God)
Ain't wanna hug the boy (On gang)
But now I'm up, they turn around, like, ""Who the fuck the boy?""
Bitch, don't text me, talking out yo' neck, boy, please don't let me
Get near yo' bitch, boy, she gon' sex me
Call Becky up, we gon' go and buy a boat

Bitch, I like jet skis, I like gettin' money, makin' shorties come and neck me
I like drinkin' forties wit my muhfuckin' besties
Talkin' 'bout, ""He know me,"" boy, he know he never met me
Mo' money, mo' problems, but that money got me right
Happened overnight, boy got a name, they ain't wanna fight
My style so nice, who couldn't like me?
The ones who ain't on my team
These rappers copy writin', they music don't excite me
Boy, I hear the same shit, different nigga, same style
And don't compare me to these rappers when they money counterfeit
Real recognize real and I don't see a lot of it
I got ninety-nine problems and ain't one of em' a bitch
That should let you niggas know that I ain't worried 'bout shit, nigga

I remember life was simple with the little nine to five
Tryna stride just so I could book the studio time
Cinco told me everybody gonna know bout' Mike Dimes
Now I hear my music playin' while I'm workin' part-time
Who that be? Double Lamb OG, hottest in the street, yeah that's me
I'm the man that yo' father tryna be, who that be?
I'm the nigga that yo' daughter tryna see, who that be?
I'm the rapper that yo' brother want a feat' from
I earn my three stripes like a nigga joined Adidas
My number M-I-A, can only reach me through a beeper
I know they talkin' 'bout me 'cause they know I'm not gon' speak
Real ballers know to never throw the ball into the bleachers
I'm hot lil' nigga, everybody tryna hit my line (Where he at?)
Tryna talk, can't waste my time (Can't, can't)
Make niggas rap my lines (On God)
These hoes just want my shine (It's true)
They don't even know about me but they say they love Mike Dimes
But I do the same shit just to get between them thighs
Bitch, I'm poppin', my cover in my story like a logo, Johnny Stockton (Ayy, ayy, ayy, on gang)
The trendin' topic, it's so ironic
These hoes was just tryna call my ass toxic
But everything changed when them labels started plottin'[Chorus]

(Go crazy, go crazy)
[Verse 1]
I ain't ever have shit, double Lamb' OG
Mike Dimes is a one man army
Everybody got hands when a nigga got bands
Where were you when a nigga was starvin'?
Can't walk with no nigga, can't walk with no bitch
'Cause a hoe is a hoe in my logic
My pockets from Houston, got rockets
My hoe is a check, she a profit
And I come through quick when I come through quick
No sorrow for niggas who crossed me
If he dead in my eyes or he dead in real life
Ain't no difference to me besides bodies and coffins
I'm a rеal nigga, not one for the dissin'
But half of thesе niggas be cappin' they disses
Claimin' they up but I look at the tracks
And these niggas be payin' to fake they positions
[Pre-Chorus]
These niggas be cap, that's facts (That's facts)
These niggas don't be in no trap (That's facts)
These niggas ain't 'bout what they rap (That's facts)
These niggas clap hands, they don't clap no strap (That's facts)
These niggas be cap, that's facts (That's facts)

I can't fuck with these niggas, they phony (Phony)
I can't trust no lil' bop tryna hoe me (She hoein')
[Verse 2]
And I promise I got that bag, I ain't never look back
Ten toes, double O, add three plus seven
That's ten outta ten, niggas tryna be cared for
Dolla can't step like Dimes be steppin'
And I talk that talk 'cause I walk that walk
Real nigga, bona fide, all truth I'm tellin'
Know niggas who really be felons
Your niggas just talk 'bout the fellas (Go crazy, go crazy)
The dash panoramic, for real
Fuck a deal, I'ma make me a deal
Get a mill' and a house on the Hills
City nigga, act up, fuck around and get killed
I was never for the act, rather move solo and make my own stacks
I carry my team, I got scars on my back
No nigga can say that they helped me with that
And nigga, that's facts[Chorus]
I move by my lonely
My lonely, my lonely
I can't fuck with these niggas, they phony
They phony, they phony
I can't trust no lil' bop tryna hoe me
She hoein', she hoein'

Mm, yeah (Dran Fresh)
[Verse 1]
Bitch, I feel Mister Back-to-Back
'Cause if I drop a track, it takes 'em back to back
Before the racks, before I carried gas, I had to serve 'em packs
I never was one for the scene, I wanted the green
I do it for gas and the Gs, the P-I-M-P-S
The niggas that hated on me, my nigga, fuck your team
'Cause when I got them racks
The opps start comin' back, the thots start comin' back
With all these racks, I could just fuck around and break your mommy's back
And do it all behind the scenes, she wantеd the green
She do it for gas and the Gs, thе P-I-M-P-S
She used to hate on me but now she lovin' me
Nah, my nigga, fuck that, she could not sit on this nut sack
Before the money start comin', in Mike wasn't nothin
They ain't give a fuck if I rap
They just talk about it, I been 'bout it, I was in the trap
The homie kicked me out 'cause I was gifted and they had to trap
We hopped in the car with the windows up, brodie gripped his clutch
I didn't think too much but homie in the back was tryna front
He said, ""Roll the window down, I'm tryna bump, my nigga""
He wasn't thinkin' 'bout the opps, just his blunt, my nigga
[Pre-Chorus]
Is you gon' ride? (With your windows down)
Then nigga, you gon' die (With your windows down)
Could fuck around and lose your pride (With your windows down)
We call it suicide (When your window's down)
[Chorus]
Is you gon' ride? (With your windows down, with your windows down)
Then nigga, you gon' die (With your windows down, with your windows down)
Could fuck around and lose your pride (With your windows down, with your windows down)
We call it suicide (When your window's down, when your window's down)
[Verse 2]
Have you ever had your brother snake you out to get some pussy? (Yeah)
Have you ever left your brothers 'cause you found out they was pussy? (Yeah)
Plottin', watchin' every move 'cause they knew I was a blessin'
Smith & Wesson, they don't backstab 'cause Glocks got they attention
Had to cut off every nigga that was ever in my circle
Leechin' off my ass to get some cash, I ain't even rebuttal
Move in silence, leave the violence, that what Dom told me to do
If I speak on every blessin', they gon' try to take a move
[Pre-Chorus]
Momma said, ""Don't ever ride"" with your windows down
'Cause if we do, we might just die with our windows down
Don't let them ever take your pride with your windows down
But we got the windows down 'cause we like the windows down
Ask them niggas, ""They gon' ride?"" (With they windows down)
Then nigga, you gon' die (With they windows down)
Could fuck around and lose your pride (With they windows down)
And we call it suicide and we don't like suicide[Chorus]
Ask them niggas, ""They gon' ride?"" (With your windows down, with your windows down)
Then nigga, you gon' die (With your windows down, with your windows down)
Could fuck around and lose your pride (With your windows down, with your windows down)

The big-eared bandit is tossin' all his manners
In a bag and wrappin' them in Saran wrap bandages
Tossin' 'em in baskets with the rest of those sandwiches
So when he says, ""Catch up, nigga,"" it looks like an accident
Um, flowing like my pad is the maxiest
My bitch white and black like she's been mimicking a panda
It's the dark-skinned nigga, kissing bitches in Canada
Then kicking all out like Mr. Lawrence did Pamela
Put her in the chamber all against her Wilt Chamberlain
I never had a reason, nigga, I was just Ableton
Not a fucking Logic-contradicting dickhead
(Not a Logic)
Flyer than an ostrich moshing in a tar pit
Semen-scented cheetah printed tee
In that 'Preme five-panel,
I'll repeat it for the season (Hahaha)
Previous items in the present
With the normal-ass past like I cheated on my team
It's me (Tried to get that nigga, but, Golf Wang see, he did come back, though)

To have some type of knowledge that is one perception
But knowin' you own your opponent is a defeatin' bonus
I'm Zeus to a Kronos,
cartilage cartridge is boneless
Smiles of cowards in lead showers,
dead spouses in red blouses
Children who fled houses on Mustang horses and went joustin'
I'm on my Robin Hood shit, robbing in the hood
Whips, drugs, jewels and your pet, I'm stealin' your rims
Coke diamonds and your Vette,
soldiers lace the fuckin' boot
And salute like the troop, when they shoot, you gon' brrrooop
It's KILLHodgy,

And out my Kool-Aid, Juice

Hodgy got the juice, I got the gin
Jasper got the Henny, my nigga, we get it in
Wolf Gang party at the hotel
I call a ho, you call a ho, and all the hoes tell
You know Left Brain need a freak (Yeah)
I need a bitch to go down like a Nitty beat
Yup, uh, and her ass fat
Don't be surprised if I ask where the hash at
Nigga, I'm tryna smoke, bitch, get higher (What up, what up, what's up, smoke)
Domo, where that Flocka Flame? Talking 'bout a lighter
Still bang salute me or just shoot me
'Cause if you don't salute me then my team will do the shooting
Yeah, my nigga Ace will pull the black jack
The king Mike G is in the cut with the black mac
We like the mafia, bitch, don't get to slacking up
And if these haters acting up, throw 'em in the aqueduct
Free my nigga Earl,
yo, I don't really ask for much
But two bad bitches in front of me cunnilingus[Verse 4: Mike G]
(We out here)
What the fuck is caution?
Often I leave 'em flossing in KAWS,
exes next to coffins
Lost in translation, the dreams you chase
Got you diving for the plates like you stealing home base
That's great, I'm home alone dreaming of two on ones
With Rihanna and Christina Milian, bring it on
And Travis is in the closet organizing and hanging the tramp
Three lettermans that Ace has been making him
No strays while we catching matinees, huh?
I'm getting blazed thinking 'bout those days
I had the top off the GT3 like toupees
One finger in the air,
all's fair when crime pays
My grand scheme of things is to be attached
To the game like bitches to their wedding rings
And you don't even need to look 'cause we gleam obscene
In the light, ride slow to my yellow diamond shining
Like the Batman logo over Gotham, rock LA to Harlem
If you say, ""Get 'em, Mike G,"" then I got 'em
One man squadron, nigga, I'm a problem
From Briggs, I got bars
and plans to
Pimp these Polish bitches into pop stars
Humanity kills, we all suffer from insanity still
And if I said it then it is or it's gonna be real
OF 'til I OD and I probably will, uh[Verse 5: Domo Genesis]
It's still Mr. Smoke-a-Lotta-Pot, get your baby mommy popped
With my other snobby bop, do I love her? Probably not
Know your shit is not as hot as anything I fuckin' drop
Bitch, I'm in the zone,
stand alone, like Macaulay Culk
I've been runnin' blocks since a snotty tot
Big wheel was a big deal with the water Glocks
Now I'm all grown,
same song, just a different waltz
Fire what I talk, but still cooler than an Otter Pop
Op, Dom next shit in your wish list
Mad sick shit, mad dick for your bitches
On some slick shit, your mistress on my hit list
And I'm lifted 'til I'm stiff outta this bitch
Odd in your motherfuckin' area (Motherfuckin' area)
Blood clots give me five feet 'fore I bury ya
('Fore I bury ya)
Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya
(Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya)
Tyler got the mask like he held Jim Carrey up
And fuck your team, ho, nigga, wassup? (Wassup?)
Wolf Gang so you know we not givin' no fucks
You know me dog, I'm a chill in the cut
So I can cut it short, break it down, couple pounds, roll it up
[Interlude: Frank Ocean]
Get me a Persian rug where the center looks like Galaga
Right, right
[Verse 6: Frank Ocean]
Rent a supercar for a day
Drive around with your friends,
smoke a gram of that haze
Bro, easy on the ounce, that's a lot for a day
But just enough for a week, my nigga, what can I say?
I'm high and I'm bi, wait, I mean I'm straight
I'ma get you this wine, the runner just brought the grapes
My brother give it some time, Morris, and Day
Course you know the vibe's just as fly as the rhymes
On the song, cut and you could sample the feel
Headphone bleed, make this shit sound real
Used to work the grill, fat burger and fries
Then I made a mil' and them psychics was liars
Now, how many fucking crystal balls can I buy and own?
Humble old me had to flex for the folks
Down in Muscle Beach pumping iron and bone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Yeah, bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone
[Interlude: Jasper Dolphin]
Goddammit!
Rapping is stupid and it's hard
Gotta do it over and over and over again but here it go
[Verse 7: Jasper Dolphin]
Hey, it's Jasper, not even a rapper
Only on this beat to make my racks grow faster
Got a TV show, so I guess I'm an actor
Pothead, half-baked, lookin' like Chappelle
Rollin' up a blunt with that fire from hell (Woo)
Still ignorant, still hit a bitch
(Wow)
Wolf Gang, nigga, so I still don't give a shit (Woo)
Catch me in the back with Miley's on my lap
(Shit)
Bong rips as I feel on that little bitch cat
(Cat)
[Interlude: Jasper Dolphin & Earl Sweatshirt]
Hah, nigga came through with a 9-bar real quick
Just for the bitches, little bit of money in my pocket
Fuck it, Wolf Gang
Yeah, fuck that
[Verse 8: Earl Sweatshirt]
Look, for contrast, here's a pair of lips
Swallowin' sarapin, settin' fire to sheriff's whips
(Whoops, whoops!)
Fuckin' All-American terrorist
Crushin' rapper larynx to feed 'em a fuckin' carrot stick
And me? I just spent a year Ferrisin'
And lost a little sanity to show you what hysterics is
Spit 'til the lips meet the bottom of a barrel,
so that sterile piss
Flow remind these niggas where embarrassed is
Narrow, tight line, might impair him since
I made it back to Fahrenheit,
grimey get dinero type
Feral, fuckin' ill-apparel-wearin' pack of parasites
Threw his own youth off the roof after paradise
La di da di, back in here to fuck the party up
Raidin' fridges, tippin' over vases with a tommy gun
Never dollars, poppa make it rain hockey pucks
And sixty-day chips from fuckin' awesome anonymous
Call him bloated 'til he show 'em that the flow deluxe
Off the wall loafers,
Four Loko in a cobra clutch
Vocals bold and rough, evoke a ho to pose as drum
And let me hit and beat it with a stick until the hole is numb
The culprit of the potent punch
Scoldin' hot as dunkin' scrotum in a Folgers cup
Or Nevada,
drivin' drunk inside a stolen truck
And shittin' like his colon bust
Belly full of chicken and a fifth of old petroleum
Supernova, I'm rollin' over the novices
And roamin' through the forest and spittin' cold as his porridge is
Stay gold 'til the case closed and the story end
Post mortem porkin' this rap shit and record it
To escort it to the morgue again,
lord of lips
Bored of this, forklift the tippy top, best under 40 list
Stormin' the gate, ensurin' the bass
Scorchin', leave these motherfuckers sore in torso and face (Ugh)
Get at me, we savages, half a pack of Apache
Indian pack of niggas who don't give a fuck
if we nasty as flatulence
As a matter of fact, your swagger is tacky
So see me, you can't, like Crunchy Black catchin' a taxi
Uh, back like lateral passin'
With that motherfuckin' gladiator manner of rappin'
As an addict, I let Percocet and Xannies relax me
Fall back if your paddies is Maxi, please
[Verse 9: Tyler, the Creator]
OF, shit, that's all I got
From my bigger brother Frankie to my little brother Tac
From that father figure Clancy
to that skatey nigga Nak
Shreddin' down 'Fax, Wolf Gang run the fuckin' block
Storefront, knee tat
Book cover is the same lettering on lettermans and cotton socks
And grip tape... and my shoes
Um, I was fifteen when I first drew that donut
Five years later, for our label, yeah, we own it
I started an empire, I ain't even old enough
To drink a fucking beer, I'm tipsy off this soda pop
This is for the niggers in the suburbs
And the white kids with nigga friends that say the n-word
And the ones who got called weird, fag, bitch, nerd
'Cause you was into jazz, kitty cats and Steven Spielberg
They say we ain't actin' right
Always try to turn our fuckin' color into black and white
But they'll never change 'em, never understand 'em
Radical's my anthem, turn my fuckin' amps up
So instead of critiquing and bitchin', bein' mad as fuck
Just admit, not only are we talented, we're rad as fuck, bitches

Where were you when all the dogs needed help?
Lawyers and the commissary ain't gon' pay itself
Where your ass was at when we recorded in the bathroom?
Where your ass was at? I take attendance like a classroom
Man I ain't got no choice
'Cause nowadays I swear this shit done changed up for the boy
I'm self-made, selfish with my women, self-employed
I'll buy the neighbor's house if they complain about the noise

Where your ass was at dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at dog? You made me pull this gun out
[Verse 4: Future]
60 for a walk through, bitch don't panic
Had them bitches fall through fucking like a savage
Heard you tryna swim in the ocean no jacket
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Serve a lot of dog food, call you a mutt
Where your ass was at dog, when I was on my come-up?
The reason I'm here today 'cause I ain't never gave up
[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out
[Outro: Future]
Where you ass was at, when I was trapping in the store?
Had to struggle to get where I'm at and sell dope
Juugin' out the stove and we still bangin', honest
Blowing on the O, yo, we call that ho an onion"

Like a nigga don't dance, but he make moves
They fuck around, now a nigga gotta shame you
I'm shameless, I be rockin' all my chains too
They told me, ""Boy I think the money's startin' to change you""
Lord save you, Lord save you
'Member runnin' through the city in the same shoes
Now I'm gunnin' in the Benz and the Range too
I'm on point, know a nigga never take two
They said I couldn't reach Mars, so I turned to a star
Now I might have fucked around, might have raised up the bar
Now I'm talkin' cash, talk cash all in my palm
My nigga Cash said, ""Watch what they do for the ones""
I know she wanna be poppin' all over the 'Gram
When the cameras come out, wanna hold my hand
Must be out of your mind, do you know who I am?
Man, you're killin' my vibe, do you know who I am?
Oh, yeah

I might end up with your ho if I take one (Still comin')
Now days if they don't have a story, they gon' make one (Still comin')
Last night I gave my heart to a fake one (Still comin')

It's hard to tell the real stories from the fake ones (Yeah, comin')

Used to hit it from behind, do you know who I am? (Never say my name)
I can't give you all my time, do you know who I am? (Give you my t-)
Make you fall in love tonight, must don't know who I am, I am
I showed you a million, no videos (No videos)
I opened up Bentley doors, I invented doors (I invented)
Bodies droppin' and we duckin' the law
If you the one to take the blame, you can't say what you saw, no[Chorus: The Weeknd & Future]

Shameless, I've been rockin' all my chains too (Keep comin')

You must not know who I am

My brother Casino said you wasn't Freebandz (Freebandz)
And at the time I couldn't see what he was sayin' (He was sayin')

I'm a boss, I'ma make my own family (La familia)

Bicken back, bicken back being bool
[Verse 1]
Pull up on the block, like, ""What!""
Fuck the police, niggas better call the SWAT
I ain't never played with the pot
I was in your house tryin' to find a spot to extend my knots
I went to jail for a flock, came home with a strike
You went to jail as a bitch, came home as a dyke
Nigga, yikes! I don't play that shit
Wifey like SEGA; I don't play that bitch
I’m a real Bompton nigga with a motherfuckin' attitude
Walk up in the spot, you would think that a nigga mad at you
I was on the block chillin'; homies, what's the mission?
Came back in a quickness, hoping there wasn't no witness
And they came back shootin'
My homies went back shootin'
Ain’t nobody hittin' nothing, man, this shit getting stupid
And my homies with the news, so they grabbed that tool
This all started from a day of niggas bicken back being bool

Bicken back, bicken back being bool
[Verse 2]
Verse two, the sun come down
You know when the sun come down them guns come out
Click clack, bow, bow bow bow bow bow
I used to rob niggas
That's probably why they try to rob my style
And karma is a motherfuckin' biatch
You got your homie in jail, you sniatch
All in the court telling the judge who it is
Like a bitch when you get to the pen, niggas on your wig
Niggas be lurkin', bitches be slurpin'
Niggas got caught up on them Nextels chirpin'
Did some months in the county, I ain't have no patience
My bitch wouldn't come see me, I was in there masturbatin'
Smoking on a bigarette, eating a bowl of bereal
Niggas on the block selling O's like Cheerios[Interlude]
Aye, nigga, nigga, nigga
I got a whole zone right now
Like, right now, right now
Like, what you tryin' to do right now?

Just when I thought it wouldn't get no sicker
Woke up one morning and heard this weird ass mothafucka talkin' out the side of his neck
Me and all my peoples, we always thought he was straight
Influential mothafucka when it came to the business
But now, since we know how you really feel
This how we feel

I like white folks, but I don't like you
All the niggas in the hood wanna fight you
Surprised El Chapo ain't tried to snipe you
Surprised the Nation of Islam ain't tried to find you
Have a rally out in L.A., we gon' fuck it up
Home of the Rodney King riot, we don't give a fuck
Black students, ejected from your rally, what?
I'm ready to go right now, your racist ass did too much
I'm 'bout to turn Black Panther
Don't let Donald Trump win, that nigga cancer
He too rich, he ain't got the answers
He can't make decisions for this country, he gon' crash us
No, we can't be a slave for him
He got me appreciatin' Obama way more
Hey Donald, and everyone that follows
You gave us your reason to be President, but we hate yours

Nigga, am I trippin'? Let me know
I thought all that Donald Trump bullshit was a joke
Know what they say, when rich niggas go broke...
Look, Reagan sold coke, Obama sold hope
Donald Trump spent his trust fund money on the vote
I'm from a place where you prolly can't go
Speakin' for some people that you prolly ain't know
It's pressure built up and it's prolly gon' blow
And if we say go then they're prolly gon' go
You vote Trump then you're prolly on dope
And if you like me then you prolly ain't know
And if you been to jail you can prolly still vote
We let this nigga win, we gon' prolly feel broke
You build walls, we gon' prolly dig holes
And if your ass do win, you gon' prolly get smoked, nigga
Fuck you!

We the people of this country
We got a voice too
We will be seen

Hold up, I fuck with Mexicans, got a plug with Mexicans
When the low low need a switch, who I call? A Mexican
This Comedy Central ass nigga couldn't be the President
Hold up, Nip, tell the world how you fuck with Mexicans
It wouldn't be the USA without Mexicans
And if it's time to team up, shit, let's begin
Black love, brown pride in the sets again
White people feel the same as my next of kin
If we let this nigga win, God bless the kids
God bless the kids, this nigga wicked and wigged
When me and Nip link, that's Bloods and Crips

I've been lit since brunch, thot shit
Order '42 for the table, let’s pop shit
Missionary or doggystyle, I'ma top shit
Pussy-ass niggas hatin' on me from the closet, ah
Hoes tryna call me a snake, shit, I guess I can relate
'Cause a bitch spit a whole lotta venom
And since these hoes all rats, when they come around me
All I see is a whole lotta dinner
I walk around the house butt-naked
And I stop at every mirror just to stare at my own posterior
I don't give a fuck who talk behind my back
'Cause the bitch knew better than to let me hear her (Ah)

No, I'm not a patient, but I let him treat me
I gotta be a doctor how I’m orderin' CCs
Go to your place, no face, no case
Ninety-nine percent tint in a blacked-out Wraith
I remember hoes used to clap for me happily
Now I'm bossed up and them same hoes mad at me
Acting like they ridin', whole time tryna pass me
Watchin' me go through it and still tryna drag me
Actin' like you winnin', if you think about it, actually
Are they supportin' you or really just attackin' me?

My pen a freak, it'll go after a bitch or a nigga (Huh)
Big bank take lil' bank, bitch, add it up
Hoes takin' shots, but they ain't in my caliber
Booked, but I squeeze a lil' head in my calendar
Lookin' in the mirror like, ""Damn, I don't brag enough""
LVs, double C's, Birkins, I'm workin'
My chain ain't hittin' if a bitch ain't hurtin'
Look, I ain't even finna argue with a bitch
One thing I know, two things for certain
None of these hoes sayin' shit to my face
And none of these hoes finna see me at the bank
And I'ma keep talkin' all the shit that I want
And I dare one of these hoes come tell me I can't

Why you wanna play with me? You know I'm undefeated
A real hot girl know how to keep a nigga heated
You say you want respect, well, treat me how you wanna be treated
You told me keep it real, but you don't practice what you preachin'
You want me to blow your phone up and come a-lookin' for you 'til I find ya
You really want me to whoop the ho that you fuckin' with if I find her
Bitch, you ain't that busy, I don't give a fuck what you ain't got time for
You look me in my eyes and know you lying, man, that's fraud, bruh
Man, you knew I was a player 'fore you met me, need to relax

I ain't turn into no bad bitch when you met me, boy, I been that

He probably thinkin' I'm in pain, but I'm really on game
Ain't no nigga finna stop me, independent, I got me
All the shit that I be needin', can't depend on a ""probably""
And that's fucked up, 'cause you know that I don't fuck with nobody
I be quiet, but you out here tellin' stories, one-sided
I ain't perfect and I try to fix the shit that ain't workin'
But it's 2020, I ain't finna argue 'bout twerkin'

Me gusta cuando que tú tiene hambre
I call you papi and you call me mami

Uh, he said I'm driving him loco, he know I'm too fly to be local
Any friend of mine gotta be fine anti-social
And Grande, she don’t like 'em broke, yo tampoco
He fell in love with the coco
Gave him peace of mind, he spent his last dime on the toto
Siempre sale en mis fotos
Too bad I don't though, 'cuz I don't need no extra promo
Get down with my mafioso
You can decide whether you want it plata o plomo
I do my dirt on the low though
Trap all I know, though
You ain't got whose money? ¿Cómo?

Please don't panic over my lingo, both of my feet so planted
Gold weddin' ring on my finger, but yet I'm still killin' 'em singlehanded
Drum on the gun like I'm Ringo
I'm in this bitch with no chain like I'm Django
We from the ends where they know that they can't go
She go both ways so I'm tastin' the rainbow (Ha)
Yummy, they got no more bread, they're crummy
The same way that Melo was starin' at Rih is the way that I stare at the money
I'm ready to risk it all if I lift it, bet I won't miss it, you a statistic
Thought shit was sweet 'til we popped up and popped off the top of your mystic
I go ballistic
Hopped out the drop, got the drop on an opp, now I'm opportunistic
I like to shop in the District
Coppin' this, coppin' that, I'm proper capitalistic, uh
Dreamer, Dreamer runnin' the game in my signature trainers
Balenciaga for joggers, I might just wear Crocs at the O2 arena
Splendid, got no limits, should have a tank on my pendant
Blokes goin' broke tryna keep up with Cole, but I make it back soon as I spend it
Maybach tinted, ""'Scuse me, sir, but ain't that rented?""
I'm offended, straight cash for my Benzes, we don't pay back interest
Aim at fences when I swing, pay respects and kiss my ring
Even Elizabeth said I'm king, haha
(Well he's bloody well right, isn't he? Haha)
Why would I choose between this one or that one
When I know that I can have both?
I laugh at these rappers for cappin'
I guess T.I.P ain't the only one out here with jokes
Mans don't want smoke
I just don't understand
I don't even think they should be allowed to breathe the same air as him if you asked me[Outro: BIA]

Ja nie dobieram słów, docieram do głów tylko tych co otwarte
Na trackach zawsze masz prawdę, i miej pewność też, że nie zamknę się
Jak do roboty za hajsem szedł, ten ReTo to było beką w chuj
A gdy chce mieć go za pasję, to już mendą jest i się sprzedał, cóż
O sprzedaży wiem wiele, w sieci znajdziesz dowody
Do wody wrzucam sieci, łapię płotki za ogony
Kurwy myślą, że na sezon wpadłem, a co to to nie
Kurwy, zbyt przyjemne dla mnie wasz ból dupy bym gdzieś szedł
Mówią newschoolom tu chodzi o cash, cash i to już nie rap jest jak chcą tylko kwit brać
A dinozaury na jednym patencie pierdolą dekadę was kurwa bez mydła

Nie stać nas jeszcze by wejść w stały związek, ale jak gram to je mam na skinienie

Po wydanych płytach chcę mieć siano by mieć gdzieś sos

Możesz mieć najlepsze flow, i najlepszy miks
Nawet diamentowego mieć majka, ale nic nie zabrzmi lepiej niż prawda
Nie umiesz się przyznać do błędu, to ludzie do ciebie nie będą przyznawać się też
Już ci wariograf szaleje, a pierwsze pytanie nie padło nawet
Nie ma tu żadnego boga, ten jebany wymysł to fama i już
Ja też wierzę w to życie wieczne ale dla mnie gwarant to sława nie bóg
Prawda buduje i burzy, prawda rujnuje złych ludzi
Nieprawda zazwyczaj tych drugich, nikomu nie trzeba służyć
Każdy jest ziomkiem dopóki jest dobrze, a potem jest poczta głosowa lub skrucha
Mężczyzną jesteś jak dźwigasz na klatę twój syf, a nie się od niego odsuwasz

Ale karma zawsze kurwa jest bezlitosna

Tyle ma do powiedzenia, a kiedyś o jednym wciąż gadał jak O.T. Genasis
Czekaj, jak to ma złoto? Nawija coś, że ma hajs i że spoko? Co?
To czemu z ekipą nie poleciał se jarać hasz do Maroko?
Chyba go ma, ale na scenę się wjebał, że wow
Na teledyskach ma bryle za dwa koła, szał, pewnie Queba mu dał
Nawijał też, że pół życia się musiał z chamami przepychać żeby sobie poszli
Tam gdzie się urodził to motylki w brzuchu ziom nie są oznaką miłości
Ja od zawsze nawijam prawdę i z dumą co rano podchodzę do lustra
Ty marny raperze odgrzewasz kotlety, twój tour bus to jebany food track
Musiałbyś stać się oszustem pajacu, żeby zrobić ze mnie oszusta
2k16 to dobry początek, coś jak śniadanie do łóżka

Quebonafide ziomek, ale jaka jest prawda?
Jestem Żydem, masonem i ajwaj, od dawna
Dziwne oko na dłoni i znaki przy skroni, sygnety, trójkąty na palcach (do diabła)
Tańczysz walca z Azazelem czy jak, jak, walca z Lucyferem za high life
Walca z judzicielem,
ej dobra wystarczy, weź wracaj, oglądać ten
Zeitgeist
Też nie wierzę, we wszystko co widzę, we wszystko co słyszę nie dowierzam bratku
Ale nie rozkminiam, to sobowtór czy fidel
Bo życie zajmuje mi dosyć sporo czasu, więc nie jest tak, że nie zasnę
Bo szkielet na Marsie
,
9/11,
doprawdy, na prawdę, zaprawdę i w prawdzie
Też miałem czkawkę i nóż na gardle
Sentino nie jest gangsterem,
Solar modelem,
Quebo raperem
Jeżdzę po mieście i słucham PNL

By zrobić ten numer opuściłem państwo, znów emigruję
Tylko, że teraz ze skrajności w skrajność
Od H8M3, aż po Rest in Peace
Rap to mój zawód, rap to nie mój zawód
Ale czasami się czuję jak syf
Gdy walę ściechę z fizyków Rehabu
To jest dla tych, co zostawili rodzinę
I wyjechali na inny kontynent
Po to, by hajsy im przywieźć
Nie zrobić se selfie z delfinem
Przez takie rzeczy się pije do zgonu
Chłopaki piszą: ""Przyjeżdżaj do ziomów!""
Kobieta pisze: ""Nie widzę cię, kotuś!""
Narzekaj, jakbyś miał mało kłopotów
A ty to przeżywasz sam
Choć wokół takich chłopaków są setki
W miesiące zmienia się chwila refleksji
W kółko ten jebany żal
Ja tak tyrałem, żeby kupić majka
Oni, by mieli co włożyć do garnka
Niewykluczone, że byłbym tu z wami, wariaty
Gdyby nie ta jebana rap gra
Nie śpię se dobę, no bo wiem, że mogę
A jak dzieci płaczą tu, no to nie moje
Ty swoje widzisz jedynie na fotkach
A słyszysz tylko w telefonie
Wysyłasz dupie wszystko, co zarobisz
By niczego nie brakowało
Ona i tak w awanturze wypomni ci
Że to o wiele za mało, a ty

Poznałem chłopaków w Anglii, Leicester
Do dzisiaj się z nimi trzymam
Byłem tam, żeby zagrać dla nich koncert
A nie co rano gdzieś zmywać naczynia
Każdy z nich ode mnie młodszy
Mówią, że raczej nie wrócą do Polski
No bo w ich miastach się dzieje masakra
O legalnych hajsach to, ziomek, zapomnij
Oni co dzień noszą w sobie smuty grube
Pierwsze kroki dziecka widzieć na Youtubie
Jest ciężko, a nie? Nawet kamień by uronił łzę
Mówisz, że Ziemia to jebany czyściec
Przeżywasz piekło i czujesz nienawiść
Inni tu boją się o tym pomyśleć
A ty sam codziennie sobie z tym radzisz
Do celu lecisz bez wizy
To ty jesteś królem, nie Beezy
Ja tylko chcę dać trochę siły tym ludziom
Bo bardziej na nią zasłużyli niż ja
Moi rodzice tak żyją X lat
Moi znajomi tak żyją X lat
Widzę ich smutek jak znowu po świętach
Tam jadą po przeklęty, jebany hajs
Liczę, że kiedyś powrócą na zawsze
Będziemy mogli się bawić jak dawniej
Dla nich chcę zarabiać grubo na rapie
Na próżne zachcianki straciłem zajawkę
Chcę z nimi siedzieć na ławce

To wszystko było tak łatwe, jak beef z Aspiratio
W końcu dostałem nominację - jak DiCaprio
Gdybyśmy chcieli się tylko postarać, życie być mogło filmem
Ale łatwiej niż coś naprawiać było ściągnąć Tinder
I znowu mam nową parę, potem znowu mam nową parę, babe
Jak sneakerhead, bo potrzebuje Cię mała jak Starków Winterfell
Albo nie, to tylko chwilowe impulsy mnie męczą
Chwi-love, ta jebana miłość się staje obsesją!
Czuliśmy razem się luźno wszędzie, nie myśleliśmy co jutro będzie
Byłem bohaterem w twoim domu, kiedy śrubokrętem
Otwierałem wino, do dzisiaj masz w oku łezkę pewnie
I ze smutną miną w samotności gapisz się w Messenger
Ale ja chyba jestem pierdolnięty
No bo lepiej mi, gdy się męczysz, wtedy naprawdę lżej mi
Krzyczysz, że to boli chamie, no bo wybrałem poligamię
Idź powiedz, że boli mamie, naprawdę fajnie, że dzwonisz, ale...

Na którego drodze stał zaledwie domek z kart
Weź sobie ten toksyczny związek, jak Walter White
Teraz ona siedzi sama i ty sam gdzieś on-line
Zmieniłeś mi status na jej ex, tacy byliście zżyci
Wróciłeś na Ziemię jak SpaceX, kumając, że z lovki nici (ziom!)
Kiedyś dałbyś sobie za mnie uciąć rękę, braciszku sprytny
A dziś żeby z kimkolwiek być chwytasz się brzytwy
Zawsze Cię bolał cudzy hajs w kieszeniach i sukces
Przez to się w Twoich nóż otwierał, może dlatego wciąż bywały puste
Może dlatego już nie masz ziomali, prócz paru nowych znajomych na przypał
W sumie to pięknie się żeście dobrali, bo też pałami są w innych ekipach
Stoisz na pobojowisku walki z samym sobą
Zadzwoń do mnie, jeśli potrzebujesz rad i polon
Pierdolisz mi coś o wspólnym melanżu

Ty zostaniesz, inne wyjdą stąd rano
To różnica między dziwką, a damą
Kiedy nie ma cię to jest załamka
I czuję się jakby mi wszystko zabrano
Chętnie byśmy na serio zaczęli
Bo tak wiele nas łączy, choć dzieli nas wszystko
Jesteśmy dla siebie stworzeni
Czuję, że to miłość, to nie jest hip-hop i fame
W głośnikach leci T-Pain, się nie wstydź, odpalaj ten flakon i lej
Za lepsze czasy, co właśnie nadeszły, nie stare momenty jak Big Daddy Kane
My zawsze razem będziemy szczęśliwi, nigdy nie wypuszczę cię z imprezy złej
Kocha mnie za to, że jestem prawdziwy i za to, że mam IQ wyższe niż jej
Dlatego nie ma między nami kłótni, kiedy wszyscy wokół sobie opijali smutki, my nie
Odrzuca nas ten udawany luz ich
My chcemy chamówki, nalewamy wódę w kubki i jeb
Nie ma dla nas ograniczeń żadnych (ojej)
Nawet jakbyśmy najebani wpadli, okej
Zakładam bandanę, piracki mam swag
Ona się ociera o mnie jak statki o brzeg
Śmiejemy się z par co chodzą napięte i niszczą relacje na własne życzenie
Ona szuka opiekuna, on szuka służącej, no niestety takie myślenie
Raczej nie skończy się porozumieniem, a kolejnym wspólnie zjebanym wieczorem
My idealnie się uzupełniamy, gdy razem nad sobą tracimy kontrolę, znów
[Refren: Beteo]
Wychodzę z nią na miasto, nie po to, żeby się całować pod latarnią
Podbija do niej jakiś lamus, mówi faux pas, łajzo
Otwieramy browar o krawężniki, lekko podpity chce palić spliffy
Popijać z nią wódę bez popity, skończyć najebany nie pobity
Wychodzi ze mną na miasto, nie po to, żeby się pochwalić koleżankom
Bo prędzej bym zrobił bagno i jeszcze naubliżał policjantom
Ale nie wstydzi się mnie, nawet nie brzydzi się mnie
Jak rzygam pijany pod klubem, czuję się dla niej wybrany to lubię
Tracimy kontrolę

Spokojna maniurka na co dzień, lecz gdy trzeba, budzi się wulkan tam w tobie
Wpadasz na wino, konsolę, furę dziś zostawiasz pod domem i luźno odpuszczasz kontrolę
Odpuszczasz kontrolę jak gdyby wjechała skarbówka i dostała w łapę sos
I z urzędu należy nam się jedynie odpinka, to summer love
Kocham te twoje dwie twarze i nie to, że Harvey Dent flow czy siostrę syjamską
Masz wiedzę kozacką i dobrze wiesz kto to był Monet, Picasso i Louis i Armstrong
Nie lubisz przytaknąć, jeżeli nie zgadzasz się na sto, to będzie dyskusja
I będzie wyluzka dopiero, gdy dojdziemy do tego, co nas poróżnia
A dzieli nas wiele i łączy nas wiele i przez to nas tak właśnie ciągnie do siebie - magnes
Trzy shoty w Aferze, czwarty nam Pelson poleje w gratisie
- transfer
Nad Wisłę Uberem
, mamy dziś siebie, po piwie w zapasie
Żadne, brać krechę na krechę, nikt z nas do lustra po drodze nie zajdzie
Przez tamkę na Powiślu, nie Tampę na Florydzie
Nie mam łajby na Marinie, ale luźno nam czas płynie

Make him give me brain (Ayy) in the front seat of the Hummer (Hummer)
Make him give me brain (Ayy) in the front seat of the Hummer (Ayy, yeah, yeah, yeah)[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
First I take off her bra, she like to fuck in the car
I just shot up the club, that mean I'm fuckin' her raw
When your bitch seen me, she fell in love on the spot
Don't wear your heart on the sleeve, don't put no trust in no thot (No)
I'm a crazy-ass nigga, got a bipolar temper
Go to sleep with my pistol, go to war 'bout my sister
I would fix my bitch body, but she was fine already
Tried to sign Mulatto, but she was signed already (Well, damn)
Chopsticks like Karrueche, I'ma film, make a movie
Sick and tired of Big Gucci, couldn't retire for Gucci
Can't expire, work for hire, favorite rapper is Gucci
Favorite trapper is Gucci,
I'm a legend like Tookie
Opposite of John Legend, I touch keys with no music
Ask ""How I know it's a hit?"" (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt), because J. White just produced it (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Favorite gun is the Uzi, favorite rapper is Gucci
Favorite trapper is Gucci, I'ma film, this a movie
[Chorus: Mulatto]
'Cause I'm a very freaky girl (Girl), get it from my mama (Mama)
I'm not with the games (Games), I'm with all the drama (Drama)
Make him give me brain (Ayy) in the front seat of the Hummer (Hummer)
Make him give me brain (Ayy) in the front seat of the Hummer (Ayy, yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause I'm a very freaky girl (Girl), get it from my mama (Mama)
I'm not with the games (Games), I'm with all the drama (Drama)

Call me BlocBoy, know I'ma shoot
Never been the type to talk it out, I ain't never goin' call a truce
Aye, I get more head than a du-rag
I get a check and run through that
And my new nigga from New Orleans
I got all of these bitches like, ""Who that?"" (Who that? Ayy)
Pull up, they like, ""Where the roof at?""
Stay by his side like a blue flag

And the mansion super big, everything his and hers
She don't kick it with the birds, and the iced out Patek on her wrist
It got her lookin' like she wanna go and surf
(Ice)
But from the gate I ain't blowin' out the cake
We been goin' eight rounds straight, now we out of shape
Smokin’ while I contemplate, I’m thinkin' ’bout the better days
When me and you, we met each other, it would never be the same (never)
Them material things, I don't care about the fame (Nah)
I miss you so much that I went and tatted your name (Tatted)
Let me be your drug, tell me when you feel in pain (Where)
And you can be my stripper baby, no I ain't ashamed
Thinkin' ’bout when I hit her, no precision, I got aim
Double R, we pullin' up and watch the Rolls all lanes
I need you in my life, I promise that I'll make it right
And by the end of the night I bet your mind gon' change

Wait

It ain't 'bout the cars, it ain't all 'bout the chains
Lookin' up, up at the stars, take a look what I became (Look at me)
What you want, a Range? What you want, a pinky ring?
I can get you what you name but love don't cost a thing (Cost a thing)[Chorus: Dayytona Fox]

Sound suppression water system now being armed for release
We have three main engines ready for ignition
Space shuttle now on internal power
Liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen fill and draining valves are closed
Saw the rocket booster flight data recorders are activated
30 seconds into the flight, Atlanta's almost two miles in altitude
Almost six miles downrange from the Kennedy Space Center already, traveling 500 miles an hour
One minute thirty seconds into the flight, fifteen miles downrange, traveling almost 2000 miles an hour

Alright, come on (Von), alright (Von)

Got a drop on this flexin' nigga, he from Tennessee
I had a thot, she be with the shit, she told me where he be
I said for sure, baby let me know if you wanna eat
She like, ""Von, you already know, just put your girl on fleek""
I'm like, ""Cool, I can do that, boo, what you want, some shoes?""
""Jimmy Choo? With a handbag, too? Red or baby blue?""
She get to smilin’, she ain't used to this 'cause she ain't used to shit
I'm just laughin', coulda been a pimp the way I move my lips
I be speedin', coulda been a driver the way I push the whip
You a ho, coulda been a bitch the way you throw a fit
But fuck that, right back to the script 'cause this a major lick
He got bricks, plus his neck is icy and it match his wrist
Now it’s like six, told her hit his phone, meet her in The Wic
But he ain’t go, but he ain't that slow, say meet ’em at the store
I'm like cool, let 'em front his move, do what he gon' do
’Cause this the plot, put 'em in the pot, let it cook like stew
I grab my Glock, it been through a lot, but it still shoot like new
We at the top, yeah we lost a lot​, but that just how it go
But check the score, if y'all lose one more, that's 6-24
Let me focus, can't be zoning out, he pullin' up now
He double parked, he ain't getting out, he in that push to start
That new Porsche, it's built like a horse, colors like the fourth
He got a ring, I guess he ain't divorced, wife probably a whore
Now she walk up, she struttin' her stuff, this bitch thick as fuck
Got in the truck, kissed him on his lip, he cuppin' her butt
Now I sneak up, crouching like a tiger, like Snoop off The Wire
Block on fire, so I take precaution, mask on, Michael Myers
I'm on his ass, he finna be mad, he gon' beat her ass
But this what happen, I got to the door, I thought I was cappin'
I was lacking, 'cause there go the opps, yellin' out, ""What's crackin'?""
I'm like, ""What?"" I'm like, ""Nigga who?"" I was born to shoot
I got aim, I'm like Johnny Dang when it comes​ to chains
So I rise, hit one in his arm, hit one in his thigh, this no lie
Bitch it's do or die, you said you gon' slide
You got some nerve, your shit on the curb, boy we put in work
From 64th, and from 65th, we not from 63rd

Just got some top from this stripper bitch, she from Kankakee
Just bought a Glock with a ruler clip, boy, don't play with me
This bitch a ho, met her at the store, you know how it go
She wanna smoke, so I bought some dope and took her to the O
Just got some top from this stripper bitch, she from Kankakee
Just bought a Glock with a ruler clip, boy, don't play with me
This bitch a ho, met her at the store, you know how it go
She wanna smoke, so I bought some dope and took her to the O
[Verse 1]
We in the car, she don't live that far, say she left her purse
And I ain't trippin', you know Von a player, we can go there first
I bust a U, pulled up to her spot, she live by the park
It's gettin' dark, my Glock on my lap, I'm just thinkin' smart
So she hop out, she switchin' and shit, this bitch thick as shit
She got two minutes, if she ain't back out, then she gon' need a Lyft
She left her phone, so I picked it up, this ho slow as fuck
Nine missed calls, three of 'em from Mom, the other six say Duck
Now I look up and I see a truck, it's just pullin' up
Someone hopped out, a big goofy nigga, he tryna look tough
I'm like, ""What? What he tryna do?"" So I clutched my move
But he kept walkin', he don't want no smoke, boy, he not bulletproof
[Chorus]
Just got some top from this stripper bitch, she from Kankakee
Just bought a Glock with a ruler clip, boy, don't play with me
This bitch a ho, met her at the store, you know how it go

This bitch a ho, met her at the store, you know how it go
She wanna smoke, so I bought some dope and took her to the O
[Verse 2]
She walk out, she stop in her tracks, she get to steppin' back
Then I hear smack, this big goofy nigga, he pullin' her tracks
I wanna help, but this ain't my ho, you know how it go
Don't got no cape, I still got her phone, she takin' too long
She get loose, she run to my car, so I hit the locks
Tossed her her phone, told shorty I'm gone, bitch, you on your own
But here come goofy, he hollerin' and shit, yellin' 'bout a bitch
Picked up a brick, he merched it on Brick and threw it at my whip
Now I'm like, ""Shit,"" I hopped out so quick, then I raised my blick
And I don't miss, I let off two shots, I hit him in his shit
Now, Von, think quick, what you finna do? 'Cause this gon' make the news
Gotta make your move, told that bitch, ""Get in,"" 'cause she lookin' confused
I broke the rules, 'cause this bitch a witness, plus I just popped dude
But she ain't cryin', plus this ho was smilin' and this bitch looked cute
So we slide out, I'm checkin' my mirrors, made it to the house
Told her hop out, she say that she hungry, I nod back, ""No doubt""
""I know you mad 'cause I smoked your man, left him on the curb""
She started laughin', she say, ""Fuck that nigga, he from 63rd""[Chorus]
Just got some top from this stripper bitch, she from Kankakee

Huh, what?
DJ on the beat, so it's a banger

Now here it go
I just made it home, missed calls on my phone
See, I been gone
Was tryna hit a lick but that shit just went wrong
I got a thot
She right off the block, her crib be the spot
And we got Glocks
Tucked all in the shit, don't come unless you knock
But this bitch grimy
Told her 'bout this nigga, helped me set him up
And she was with it
She just want some shoes and she ain't give no fucks
So we do that
I was at his neck, creepin' from the back
But saw the opps and had to let 'em have it
How fucked up is that?
But where that bitch?
She ain't called me yet, we did that at six
And who got hit?
I know someone, check 'cause King Von, he don't miss
Now two weeks pass
I'm back on my grind, I can't waste no time
The opps been quiet
They be woofin', though, but them niggas not slidin'
And I been high
I can't even lie, that thot been on my mind
Why she ain't called?
I ain't seen her ass, I hope that she aight
Now it's midnight
I'm hittin' some blocks, just me and my Glock
Came to a stop
I'm at a red light, I usually don't stop
My phone keep ringing
Just a ho, of course, this bitch prolly bored
I press ignore
I ain't got no time, a whore gon' be a whore
Now I get that feelin'
Something ain't right, I look to my right
And I'm like, damn
There go that flexing nigga, he wavin' his pipe
He get to dumpin'
Bullets get to coming, my heart get to thumpin'
I feel something
My left shoulder hot, blood just get to gushing
I'm like shit, ain't this 'bout a bitch?
And he with that bitch
I got a glimpse
She got them big lips that's made for sucking dick
Now it makes sense
That ho set me up, that lil' dirty slut
The double cross
Tryna get me caught like I'm Randy Moss
Ah, shit
I just dropped my gun, plus I got one arm
I'm tryna drive
I can't shoot back now, this man on my ass
I almost crashed
But I got the wheel, he tryna kill for real
But there go twelve
He bust a quick right and I just bust a left
[Interlude: King Von & O'Block Louie]
Aw, shit
What the fuck, gang, you good?
Damn, my shoulder
You know this bitch be fuckin' with me, gang
Damn, man, finish tellin' me about that shit that was crackin' off last week with them niggas and shit
Aw, yeah, aw, yeah, look
Now this what happened
[Verse 2]
A week later
My arm in a sling, I been
sippin' lean
Pure codeine
I don't feel a thing, my ho say I'm mean
I need a blunt
Stuff that bitch with Runtz, boy,
I'm on a hunt
And ain't no breakfast
But I'm a box a nigga, like some Cap'n Crunch
I got a tip
That that thot bitch be on 75th
Right off Cottage
With her best friend, gettin' her hair did
I'm like cool
Finna make my move, post up what I do
This bitch a fool for tryna play me out
Like this shit was cool
Now it's like two
Catch her walkin' out, her new hairstyle blue
And she look cute
But that mean shit to me, I crept up then I boomed
And that was that
Now I'm running back, I stop in my tracks
There go that Porsche
How crazy is that? Boy, I'm on his ass
The first blast
It shatter his glass, damn, this nigga fast
He hit the gas
I'm still shootin' at him, but I'm too far back
Damn, I'm hyped
Let me tuck this pipe, get up out of sight
'Cause I see lights
And them bitches bright, can't go to jail for life
So I take flight
Made it to the hood, everything went good
Knock on wood
Flame me up a 'Wood, Tooka smellin' good
Looked at my phone
Got a text from Herb, he say, ""What's the word?""
I say, ""Shit, I'm just coolin', bitch
I'm not from 63rd""[Outro]

[Chorus: King Von]
You know how I rock, I'm from that block, boy, I keep a Glock
One up top, pass it to my shorty, if the police hot
She a thot, she just suck me up, we up in your car
Crazy Story, that's her favorite song, she sing it bar for bar
Audemar, I ain't got one yet, I'll prolly go tomorrow
I'm a star, that's what mama told me, I was behind bars
When I stole that car, I ain't go that far, just around the block
I picked up Top, we was bad as hell, foenem throwin' rocks
[Verse 1: King Von]
Nuwap and Joey, they had on flip-flops
My luck, folks 'nem sellin' P's, they got the block locked
Popped up, unannounced, nigga, I'm gon' pop some
Stop frontin', doin' all that woofin' and ain't gon' drop none
Drop some, everybody holler, ""Von, drop somethin""
But I can't, 'cause all the opps dead, it's hard to drop somethin'
Smokin' on this Tooka pack and it's loud as fuck
Foenem caught Tooka ass gettin' off the bus
I know Tooka mad as hell, he probably tired of us
But when I die, find Tooka ass and I'ma beat 'em up
I kill shit, on some real shit, this the drill shit
And chill, bitch, this the Kel-Tec, I push your shit back
And sit back, this that Hellcat, this bitch go real fast
Ayy, who is that? He don't look familiar, foenem kill his ass
Aye, bill his ass
This that stinky pack, it came from Trinidad
Ain't come alone, hell nah, boy, I be with Smith & Wess'
Hit his chest, if that nigga run, fuck it, hit his back
Can't bring him back, now that nigga trendin' on the internet
You know how I move, I'm a fool, but I keep the tool
Stick and move
When you was up in school, I was on the news, breakin' the rules
Bullets hit his shirt, knock him out his shoes
Thought he was cool, but he got hit the worst
You know how I do[Chorus: King Von]
You know how I rock, I'm from that block, boy, I keep a Glock
One up top, pass it to my shorty, if the police hot
She a thot, she just suck me up, we up in your car

I picked up Top, we was bad as hell, foenem throwin' rocks
[Verse 2: Polo G]
I ain't with the back and forth, no, I just can't get into that
Get his loin, get him whacked, if he ain't check, we spinnin' back
No, I don't know Will Smith but I know 'bout the Men In Black
I know how that block work, I come straight from dealin' crack
Dissin' in them lyrics think it's sweet, no he won't ride for long
Throwin' bullets, Pat' Mahomes, go check the scope, we got it on
Chiraq always ride with chrome, .40 shells gon' crack his dome
No need to stand over him, they know for a fact he gone
And I got this bitch on fire, told her ""Hide it or pass it on""
And your bitch can vouch, been with the gang, we don't cap in song
She want fame, she latchin' on, gon' blow me like a saxophone
Late night I might do one-sixty, swervin' through the traffic cone
[Chorus: King Von]
You know how I rock, I'm from that block, boy, I keep a Glock
One up top, pass it to my shorty, if the police hot

Tee Grizzley,First Day Out by Tee Grizzley,"[Intro]
Helluva made this beat, baby
[Chorus]
These niggas prayed on my downfall (They what?)
These niggas prayed on my downfall
On all ten, bitch, I stood tall
Show these disloyal niggas how to ball
[Verse 1]
Go get a thermometer for the pot, I need this shit cooked right
Let's keep that water 400 degrees Fahrenheit
You ever been inside a federal court room?
Nigga you ever went to trial and fought for your life?
Bein' broke did somethin' to my spirit
Asked niggas to plug me, they act like they couldn't hear me
Look at me now, drivin' German engineering
You don't want your baby mama fucked, keep the ho from near me
Kilroy, 'member when I used to use your L's
To hit the road, hit the O and make them big boy sales?
Mu, 'member when you had them green things mailed?
With vacuum seals, tryin' not to have them green things smelled?
Feds was on me, what you know about related through money?
I don't know nothin', I just used to see 'em walk to the Coney
I fuck with bitches, my body count go from Pershing to Cody
Any further questions, you can take that up with the lawyer
My nigga Fenkell, J Money, Brightmo Lo, Project Joe
Will tell you every day before school I sold a half bow
How you think I won best dressed with no support?
And had them paid lawyers comin' in and out of court
Ayy, Dwan, though, ayy, Theo, ain't it a blessing?
We made it out Kentucky after all that happened?
After the pre-trials, after the status
After them impact statements, after the castle
[Verse 2]
Ayy, JR, nigga, ain't it a blessing?
We made it out of Lansing after all that happened? (We did that bitch, nigga)
After Michigan State, after Hubbard
When our mans told on us, them bands they took from us
Joy road bitch, but the money long as six mile
Brick mile, knock your bitch down
Pick her up, knock her back down, pull her tracks out
Yes I slap girl, yes I slap dog, yes I slap loud
Yes I'll slap a pussy nigga if he act out
Yes I caught cases on the road with them killers
Bro, kill me if I snitch, 'cause if you snitch I'm gon' kill ya
Spent a lot of time on that yard with them gorillas
Stood tall, did I let niggas ho me? Quit bein' silly
I know for a fact your bitch pussy get wet for a nigga
'Cause I do it better, plus I'm doin' better than niggas
I'm at home when I'm down there in Lexington nigga
'Bout the king, they gon' drop you and who next to you nigga
Unc said Lil T, ""Get ahead of them niggas!""
When you take off, don't look back and try to rescue them niggas
You killed his mans? Then make sure you get the rest of them niggas
Don't let them get the best of you, just get the revenue nigga
So let me know what you can handle, okay, come grab it
Here go some extras, so if I'm busy you can manage
Fiends had me Blade dancin', eating sixty dollar salads
Get it there and back, tell the feds I need a challenge
My first offer was 30 years, not a day lower
I told them crackers holler at me when they sober
On parole, I'm a felon,
you think I ain't got that blower?
Yeah you right, bro take his head off his fuckin' shoulders
(Boom-Boom-Boom!)
You hear me? Hit the Rollie store with the Rollie on
What was our getaway car? A Jag Portfolio
You hear me? Ayy, I heard I had some sneak dissers
Whoever feelin' hot, that AR got a heat sensor
Cuz said don't entertain them hungry niggas
I wish I would pay attention to these homeless niggas
Don't call my phone, I don't want to do no song with niggas
And tell yo bitch to tighten up before I bone her, nigga
I don't know you niggas, fuck wrong with niggas?
Through these white buffs I can see the ho in niggas
Free my nigga
Parico
, that boy be hoein' niggas
Shoot the smile off your face, I don't joke with niggas
Boy, I can't trust you with that strap if you ain't got no bodies
Boy, I can't take you on no lick if you ain't robbed nobody
You ain't no shooter, you can't do that shit without no molly
I came home and had the hoes wetter than Kalahari
Thirty months ago niggas ain't think that I was comin' home
Shout out to them niggas' freaks that I been cummin' on
Get 'em to the crib, bust 'em down, now bitch run along
This SK'll get to shakin' like there's somethin' wrong
Thirty bands two times, watch this money clone
The feds say my name hot like when the oven on
Bitch, I came home to my lil' brother gone
Niggas say they lookin' for me, pull up in the Skuddy zone
Who said I'm a snitch? You just heard a lie from him
Better check the black and white
That paperwork will vouch for him
Zero toleration for that nigga, take his life from him
He don't want that pistol play? Okay I'll Tyson him
I ain't hear from bitches when I had them blues on
So soon as I'm done fuckin', put your shoes on
I'm on parole in two states, I can't move wrong
The feds tryin' to build a case, I can't move wrong
I went to trial back to back, bitch, I'm 2-0
The state of Kentucky banned me from every jewelry store
Say I can't even be in public with my hoodie on
Michigan State don't want him here, they don't know what he on[Chorus]
I know they prayed on my downfall
I know they prayed on my downfall
On all ten, bitch, I stood tall
Show these disloyal niggas how to ball"

I'm the type to buy the store, make them restock it, ayy
Beam on everythin' I own, I will not miss (Doo-doo-doo)
Grizzley by my side like a pilot ridin' cockpit (Yeah, bro)
[Verse 8: Tee Grizzley & Lil Yachty]
Yachty, I might stop rappin' for this one reason (Oh, for real?)
If the Feds hear this shit I'm doin' a hundred seasons (Hey)
In the hood, shootin' craps in my Yeezys
Put angels on you niggas who be playin' like y'all demons
You dig?
[Verse 9: Lil Yachty]
Middle finger to them niggas hatin' and fakin'
They plottin' on my death, I give their mothers deep penetration
This diamond choker for some reason give me pure ventilation
Every real nigga livin' will respect this collaboration (Gang gang)
[Verse 10: Tee Grizzley]
We the bust down brothers, check the Rollies out
Say you winnin' one more time, I'm pullin' trophies out
Niggas know we out, no Shaqs, all Kobes out
In other words, I'm with all shooters that'll blow you down (Buh-buh-buh-buh)[Verse 11: Lil Yachty & Tee Grizzley]
From the D to the A, put respect on it (Bitch)
If that's your ho, why my dick got her mouth on it? (Bitch)
I'm from the south, I got diamonds in my teeth
I got fur on my fleece, my new ring could pay your lease
(Lease, nigga)
[Verse 12: Tee Grizzley]
Chain on my dresser next to my indictment
When they said not guilty I was so excited
From the A to the D, bitch you heard Yachty
Wraith comin' this summer, I'ma have your bitch drivin'
Bitch!"
Tee Grizzley,No Effort by Tee Grizzley,"[Chorus]
I can do this shit with no effort

Nigga
[Verse 1]
Shoes took a house I took your bitch, took that ho to town
Played my role so good after I hit I took a bow
Take some pounds for a pow
Take your time, take it serious
I'm curious, should I buy me a watch or a aquarium
Get your sack took, we gon' take you for a joke
If you like that last batch, bring some money take some mo'
Wanna take 'em to the 8, don't know which route I wanna take it
The country wait four years, we take presidents everyday, nigga
Take me to the horse, not the club, bitch the Porsche
Ho done took off with my dick, I should be takin' her to court
If you take me for a ho, I'ma take it to your porch
Only fear the Lord anyone else can see the morgue
Give me thirty seconds with her, I can get this bitch naked
One bullet out that K will leave the toughest nigga headless
Dawg, don't need one drug to act reckless
While he sober he'll up and put one in a nigga melon
One time for ma Dukes,
one time for my pops
Free Twink, rest in peace Tee fuck the opps
One time for lil' CJ
, one time for lil' Roc
50 rounds in that chop', niggas move niggas drops
One time for
Juan Doe
, he did that bid in KY
Play with me it's going down, bitch one time for Yung Joc
One time for CoKane Cash, nigga off top
One time for them (Brr), we got comin' by the flock, nigga
One time for a real nigga, Leek Hustle
And Leek will bust you, you a fool if you think Leek tussl
e
My running back come from Cali and make P's fumble
Think I work at McDonald's, I make that cheese double
Think I'm making Big Mac's, I let that bread triple
I got a big MAC, that bitch'll shred niggas
Sayin' my name better stop while your ahead
'Fore they look for your body and find nothing but your head, nigga
I don't wanna fuck if I can't get the head with it
You see the trophies ho, you talkin' to the bread winner
Lil' ungrateful bastards I can't stand niggas
Like I ain't played parents role when I fed niggas
[Chorus]
Like, lil' nigga, I can do this shit with no effort
You know I do this shit with no effort
I can do this shit with no effort
Nigga
[Verse 2]
Shout out to my niggas 'cause they grind for 'em to shine
Shoes blood, red bottom like they ride under the five
In Guam with my bitch, we in Vequayhoyle
Niggas hating but ain't never been off US soil
Nigga, this more than I started off my day with a map
And the prayer that I made it there and back
Bruh this your bitch, so why she sittin' on my lap
Let that chop' clap a pussy nigga head off his neck
Was you watchin' the news? You saw them indictments?
Okay, so you know I'm statin' facts
Last niggas we was beefin' with, uh
Man, I can't even think of what cemetery them niggas at
It'll come to me later, it's on the tip of my tongue
Nigga, I meet gangsters, Crips, Lordz and Bloods
Nigga, I meet plugs, talk over dinner 'bout funds
Only thing you meet is the requirements for a crumb
Y'all pussy niggas homo. y'all ain't got no hoes
These bitches tired of fucking 'round with hobos
Extendo on the Glock that bitch long as a pogo
Let Lil Durk music get you hype and join Jojo
Fuck nigga, I can get you knocked off no effort
The clip hanging out tonight like it ain't no tellin'
Girl say when she with me she get so wetter
Say she like to throw that ass on the low, catch her
All black and it's late-night
Assault rifle with a steak knife
Big 40 eat the nigga up but the doc think it was a great white
Red bottoms on my feet like my shoes got brake light
Fuck her and drop her off, no time for no date nights[Chorus]
Like lil' baby, I can do this shit with no effort
You know I can do this shit with no effort
Watch me do this shit with no effort

Loved each other way more than we loved life
Was so close, people thought we had a love life
We loved each other way more than we loved life

I used to be like, ""I don't need security"" (Street niggas)
I don't want these niggas thinking that it's fear in me (At all)
Told my driver, ""Be on point,"" he wasn't hearing' me (Driver)
Those shots went off, I'm steady callin', you ain't answerin', you scarin' me (Hello?)
In my city, if you winnin', you can't stay
They call bein' broke, ""Real,"" they call gettin' money, ""Fake""
I gave you a bitch, why you still lookin' at my date?
I gave you some food, why you still lookin' at my plate, nigga?
They say they love us, but that love might be hate
I can't really tell the difference, salt and sugar look the same
(It's tricky)
Look how they did Dex
,
look how they did Blade (Damn)
Look how they tried to do me, but got JB
Man, that jealousy so real, man, that hate so deep
Man, that envy shit so real, you make it out these streets
You saw it wasn't me and still shot, what she do to you? (What she do to you?)
We was just winnin', now I'm cryin' at your funeral
But every tear I shed another thousand on your head, nigga (That's on my fuckin' mama)
Now show your face and think I'm playin', nigga
Every tear I shed another thousand on your head, boy (On my daddy grave)
Now show your face and think I'm playin'
Ayy, JB, I wish I was sittin' outside with you
And I was in that bank with you
You know your favorite rapper wouldn't have never let them guys get you
I would've shot 'em, left 'em dyin', leakin' in the street
Wouldn't have ran, would've smoke the Runtz and watch that man go to sleep
And you think they came for her? Man, you know they came for me
They took my heart and my brains, niggas know that I can't think
How I'm playin' with these drums, niggas know I'm like Tay Keith
Eyes bloodshot red, niggas know I ain't been sleepin'
But all these dead loved ones make it hard to sleep (Make it hard to sleep)
All this anger inside make it hard to grieve (Make it hard to grieve)
Ayy, all this nicotine make it hard to breathe (Make it hard to breathe)
All these tears in my eyes make it hard to sleep (Make it hard to sleep)
They found a murder weapon, bro, it's gon' be hard to beat (It's gon' be hard to beat)
First offer fifty years, so it's hard to plea, ayy (It's gon' be hard to plea)
And if they do somethin' to us, then they known for it (They known for it)
But if we do somethin' to them, then we wrong for it (Then we wrong for it)

Fuck that, if you take mines, I take yours, homie (I take yours, homie)

If we tear this bitch up, they gon' say I'm dead wrong (Dead wrong)
Fuck that, these niggas got my auntie with a headstone (Damn)
Niggas tellin' me what to do like they smart as me (What?)
But they ain't take your heart from you, they took my heart from me (Bitch)
I got one less person that wanted more from me
Ready to kill whoever play with me or shorted me (Don't play)
I got your kids, I got Nanni, I got Nell too
I got your babies, Kee and Zi and Gabrielle too (Oh)
I got your sister and your mommy and your fam' too (I got 'em)
How the fuck you gon' die on me? I can't stand you (Damn)
I pray they don't go to jail, I want 'em dead
I'm just listenin' to the streets, hearin' everything they sayin'
I'm just waitin' on a name, I'm just prayin' that they say it
Give a fuck if it's the Mayor, nigga, million on his head, ayy, ayy (Whole ticket on his top)
Wish I could wake you up and beat your ass
'Cause I was just tellin' you about them dreams I had (Free my mama)
Ayy, niggas snatched my heart out my chest, can't nobody replace it
Wouldn't have ever believed you was fuckin' with your baby
""Make sure Tee good"" is all I ever heard you sayin'
Tryna hold my head, I don't know if I'ma make it (Mhm)
This shit been eatin' me (Eatin' up)
I don't know what you seen in me, but you believed in me ('Lieved in me)
Tell them ""Keep that fake love, let me grieve in peace"" (Fuck that shit)[Chorus]
You drop mines, I drop yours, homie (I drop yours)
You drop one, I drop four, homie (I drop it four)

Real niggas ain't gotta say they real[Verse 3]
I got some feelings that don't show no more
Me and some of my family, we ain't that close no more
I got some anger build inside me, I control it though
My morals out here runnin' wild, I couldn't control her bro
The first nigga from the family, take that college role
My mom and pop's couldn't even see it that's what hurt me most
Some niggas that I barely know they wanna see me make it
Some niggas I know all my life don't wanna see me blow
I had love and now it's hate for y'all that's official
I had nightmares of that picture
When we left that shootout, you still had bullets in your pistol
I don't fuck with y'all that's official
Nigga, that courtroom was empty way back at me final sentence
Got me like fuck niggas, 'cause
[Chorus]
Everybody ain't loyal, everybody ain't street
Everybody ain't you my nigga, everybody ain't me
If you real then I can see it, nigga
If you real then I can see it, nigga
Real niggas ain't gotta say they real
Real niggas ain't gotta say they real
Real niggas ain't gotta say they real"

The blue tint snatchin' souls when they touch a nigga
Your mans hit, he 'bout to die, you better rush that nigga
We the ones they know not to speak about
That chopper speaker loud, have your brains leaking out
Have your team shook and your mama freaking out

Tee Grizzley,Win by Tee Grizzley,"[Chorus]
Look me in my eyes, nigga, I'ma win
I'ma get this money, nigga, I'ma live
First nigga in my family with some legal bread
Had to risk it all just to win big
I could stack them hunnids to the roof
I ain't stopping 'til they stack to the moon
Nigga, without me, my family wouldn't have food
Anybody go against me gotta lose (Helluva made this beat, baby)
[Verse 1]
90’s baby but I get to that money like ’86 again
Lost pops and fell off, we back rich again
Gotta thank God for that prison bid
Music got us looking like the family's selling bricks again
Been on tour, been on TV, own businesses
Still I pull up with that stick and flip the whip you in (Brr)
You don't wanna hear bout indictments in the case I caught
Then, bitch, quit listening (Turn off)
Free Mar Mar, he innocent
I was in the county indigent, now my pendant lit
Bitches love me, they go crazy 'bout that real nigga shit
Used to be a young follower, I was ignorant
If you don't want me to fuck her, go everywhere with that bitch, nigga
I'll drop a bird on your head
That chopper'll blow a third of the nerves out your head
Talking cash, shit, and we murdering that man
When they put them teddy bears on the curb for your ass, you lost
[Chorus]
Look me in my eyes, nigga, I'ma win
I'ma get this money, nigga, I'ma live
First nigga in my family with some legal bread
Had to risk it all just  to win big
I could stack them hunnids to the roof
I ain't stopping 'til they stack to the moon
Nigga, without me, my family wouldn't have food
Anybody go against me gotta lose
[Verse 2: Tee Grizzley]
700K in here and my bag in this room
But it's only for your eyes, why your man's in this room?
I don't know if he a snitch, now it's blood on your hands
If you think I'm 'bout to let him leave alive, you a fool
Got a record deal, my label don't like you when I hang out (For real)
And let me know that they ain't know me 'fore I came out
Kevin Liles, I know it's a risk to have these chains out
But I'm that same nigga that'll knock a nigga brains out
Ex bitch ran off with the Rollie, hope she make it stretch
I could've killed her lil' dirty ungrateful ass
But I'm more mad at myself for tryna date a rat
Plus I make 30 for a show, so I'ma make it back
Used to order Wendy's fries, bring a shake with that
Now its Benihana rice, put some steak on that
The Mustang used to always run out of gas
Now I'm in that Wraith, touch the paint and it's a body bag, nigga[Chorus]
Look me in my eyes, nigga, I'ma win
I'ma get this money, nigga, I'ma live
First nigga in my family with some legal bread
Had to risk it all just to win big
I could stack them hunnids to the roof
I ain't stopping 'til they stack to the moon
Nigga, without me, my people wouldn't have food
Anybody go against me gotta lose
[Verse 3]
I wanna see niggas win but everybody, you can't eat around
Some niggas, I wouldn't even go to sleep around
They had the bag, but ain't help me when they see me down
Same niggas DM'ing me tryna be around
Bitch, they see that Wraith and they think Meek around
Can't be around on choppers, yeah okay that's three around
Come get your friendly ass bitch before I beat her down
After I fuck, never again will she be around
It's crazy when your own people wanna bring you down
These niggas don't even know what they wanna beef about
He shot at me, and that's somethin' I can't sleep about
Drop his mama, leave the town, bitch, we even now (Brr)
How you gon' motivate the youth, rapping that gangster shit?
This what they like, so I'ma make the shit
But even still, this my life, I gotta claim this shit
So even if they didn't like it, I ain't changing shit, nigga[Outro]
Look me in my eyes, nigga, I'ma win
I'ma get this money, nigga, I'ma live
First nigga in my family with some legal bread
So I can buy whatever ice, buy whatever crib
I could stack them hunnids to the roof
I ain't stopping 'til they stack to the moon, nigga
Without me, my family wouldn't have food
Anybody go against me gotta lose, nigga"

Done politickin' with the competition, what's the word? (Yeah)
Put that on my mama, nigga, eight in the process
Niggas tryna tippy-toe through the progress
Tongue-tied when the truth is an object
What's the pros and the cons of this next check?
Wasn't nobody 'round, I was independent
In the '90s, sittin' bum with the windows tinted
Heard a bum got a strap in the party
Who the fuck let this **** in the party?
Beat 'em up, beat 'em up, beat 'em up, beat 'em up (Ah)
I was seein' double in the projects
Mad at myself when I put it to the side
Mama had to cater for the coupe
That we rode after school on the way to Popeyes
And niggas wanna play both sides
It's a red dot, don't get on the wrong red eye
It's a headshot, Damien Kane, Woo
Them guys
Fuck around and bury two of them guys
I'm OD in Paris, I'm OD in France
I thought that I told you, I need the advance
Put down your IG and look through my lens
A million to grandma, who did I offend?
The girl of your dreams to me is a fan
I netted ten million and did a lil' dance
I'm fuckin' the world, I unzip my pants
My uncle G told me that I had a chance
So then I popped out and did it again
And did it again and did it again
I can not respect them, where did he begin?
Advice from the council, let nobody in
Been swervin' through rumors
Avoidin' the trends and duckin' the hoes
I'm duckin' the loonies that come with the shows
I'm grateful to Man-Man, he opened up doors
A bunk on the tour bus to come and compose
I reach to the stars on my tippy toes
This greatest success where most niggas fold
I tell you my past, that shit don't get old
But how could you ask like I don't be writin' my raps?
These critics got everyone tapped
You gotta relax, the city where nobody sleep
Just tap in and ask where I'm at, ho

Every contract gotta put my kid's family in school
Health and wealth, goin' deep for it,
do right for my next life
Let me get some too
I remember roaches, mama lost focus
I was at home, no lights, no food
Heard that the joke is ""Hykeem broke""
And head to the ground when I walk in school
Goin' through the motions, mad impulsive
Granny, I won't abide by the rules
I shall reside with advisers to boom
Fuck that, Booman, let me get some too
Life ain't always about your name in they mouth
And the cars and the clothes and the jewels (Jewels, oh)
Every lil' bitch that's born looking like soft porn
Only meant for your ego to bruise (Bruise, oh)
Bet when the hoes get bored and the points ain't score
You gon' live in this world confused ('Fused, woah)
Every day, the hate restored and the faith get short
Fuck that, let me get some too
Nigga, my livelihood was understood
That the roof I'm in not bool
Nigga, the shoes I fill are huge
""Keem, wanna share that ho?"" Bro, move

I can't help but feel neglected
Changin' up the schedule, your calendar refreshin'
Time pass and we move on, nobody says shit
How I'm 'posed to act when my morals ain't respected?
How you 'posed to act when your feelings ain't protected?
I'm cashin' checks just to get some neck and some necklaces
What's next? War and turbulence, prayin' on this plane
Success, got a taste of it, never was the same
[Verse 1]
Trademark on that pussy, trademarkin' my brand-new bitch
Yеah, duh, hol' up, blood, hol' up, cuh, hol' up, sis, huh (Hol' up)
LLC the Glock and I LLC my bitch, huh (LLC)
Pass me the rock, I go crazy on my kicks, huh
Had to tеll my grandma, ""Sit back, relax"" and shit, huh (Make nigga)
Make nigga buy her house and car, she's off the list, huh
Fake nigga, talkin' 'bout he rich but barely is, huh
Eight figures, jumpin' off the stage into the kids, huh (Yeah)
Single out the shooter, take the shooter to the blitz, huh (Yeah)
Droppin' out of school, dropped deposit on their crib, huh (Yeah)
Poppin' out on Instagram, I only post my bitch, huh
I don't need your input, get your two cents off my pic, huh
Generation money, type of money dyin' rich
And I wanna say, ""Shoutout to the dead, now I flex,"" woah
[Chorus]
Shoutout to the dead, to the dead, to the dead, huh
Shoutout to the dead, to the dead, to the dead, huh (Let's go)
Shoutout to the dead, to the dead, to the dead, huh (Let's go)
Shoutout to the dead, to the dead, to the dead, huh (One)
[Verse 2]
I'm sick of you niggas not taking a risk
I'm taking advantage and taking my course (Kill 'em)
I cannot compete with the mud in my system
My tolerance low, I don't tolerate force
I protect, I am the one
I rose up for the score
I gotta let my ego go
You niggas not ready to settle the war (Yeah)
You niggas not ready to stop bein' hoes
You niggas not ready to open the doors
You niggas run in, take off with the drawer
You niggas not really the richest on Forbes
You niggas not ready to deal with the sacrifices
And instead, you're passin' the torch
And check the surveillance camera at the cemetery
See me dancin' on all of your corpse, go
[Segue]
You could only have love
Ooh, could I say it more?
Could I say it more?[Part II]
[Verse 1: Baby Keem]
Ayy,
E38
Got pulled over twice, had to go and switch plates
Bitch, don't think shit sweet
I'm the same Baby Keem in forty-eight states
I play charades with the bank
Just net ten million, now I'm back with the Wraith
And I'm goin' home with the loot
Mama goin' home with a coupe
[Chorus: ROSALÍA & Baby Keem]
I'm a hot girl
A hot girl
I'm a hot girl (Make me lose my mind)
A hot girl
[Verse 2: Baby Keem]
I took the 'Lac then hopped on the flight
I cannot look towards your jaded advice
I took the torch, I quit being nice
I took the torch, now I gotta fight
You niggas impulsive, quick to make moves
You're biting your flows, a big appetite
I look at the hoes, they not at your shows
I look at your shows, they Oprah white
You gotta be nimble and quick like a fox
I don't move in silence, this shit is abrupt
I'm VVS-ed up, precise in the cut
Did she get a nut? It's not about me
As long as you good, don't worry 'bout me
I'm telling my friends that you not a freak
My new Nia Long is Kaepernick strong
And she not afraid to get on one knee
I'm back at the crib, my memory deep
I think about mama, I'm Baby Hykeem
She got that tatted before I could read
I'm spiritual now, I pray in my sleep
Twenty years long, I never had dad
My dad was a fraud, I had to be tough
Twenty million, ho, that's not enough
Don't ask no questions, bitch, go add it up
I took the light to sacrifice
I sacrificed everything I need
I could probably fuck these bitches in my sleep
Young nigga know the hustle and the Ps
Stressing 'bout money, turned to other things
I was in uncle crib at fourteen
Can't get through to mama 'cause she'd rather drink
Facin' eviction by the thirteenth[Refrain: Baby Keem]
I was fifteen, I was sixteen
I was fifteen, I was sixteen
I was fifteen, I was sixteen
I was fifteen, I was sixteen
[Chorus: ROSALÍA & Baby Keem]
I'm a hot girl
A hot girl
I'm a hot girl (Make me lose my mind)
A hot girl"

Whеn I put you in the latest, make surе he know

Rolex, woah, heart on froze
Ten white toes
It’s hot out here, I’ve hit my lows
Your leverage in the back
Your best friend was trash, trash, trash

Sixteen missed calls
Sorry, I was busy, but I missed you (Miss me when I'm coming home)
If you see me ballin' then my bitch ball

Skrrt off in the Audi (Whip), I'ma lift off (Whip, whip)
All your bitches do pilates when you're rich, dawg
So if she can't pop a squat, then that's a rip-off
Keep the CDG, y'all niggas ripped off (Oh)
And your nigga better not think that he the only one (Ooh, ooh, only one)
That nigga match his fitted with some Jordan 1s (Yeah, yeah)
If it ain't Issey, then miss me
NUWO with Hublots
Bad bitch with Chrome toes
And we shoot movies, not photos
She not in it for the fame
Nobody know her name[Refrain: Baby Keem]
Jumpin' out the coupe

I start to question what freedom is
My unc' put the Chevy on fours
I drip in all black like an emo bitch
But these are not regular clothes
These are the outfits I make a movie in (Huh)
Baby Keem count up them Frito Lays
I get the call and I go
Shawty gon' fuck all my goons, stop it
I am above the buffoons, stop it
I am above all the rules
Look at my wrist, it say ""Freeze, freeze""
I need to buy a new neck, neck, neck, neck

I cannot fuck with no corny bitch
I give 'em ten and be done with it

Sixty-two shots, I'ma knock off his fitted cap (Grrah-grrah, boom)
Be with them, show no remorse, bitch I'm flockin' that
Self-made, just tryna get paid (Like what?)
I'ma get it, it ain't no debate
Forever ten toes, I'ma always be great

Break her phone if that bitch try to post us (What?)

Gotti call thotty, we gettin' the drop
If it's up then it's stuck, leave it up at the top
When you run into me, bitch it's shoot or get shot
I got too many opps, we got too many chop's
Bitch, I shoot double hands and I'm clearin' the block
If they send me the addy, walk up, let it flock
La-di-da-di, I don't wanna party
Like 'em ratchet, I don't want a Barbie
Need a baddie who party like
Cardi
Is you ready to ride in a heartbeat?
Smoochie, no cuffin', just eat me, I'm sorry
Jack the opps, you get put in a Marley
Me and Kay two deep, no assist
One thot, two chop's, two flocks for the hit
[Verse 2: Lil Skrap 1090 & Justo B]
And you know I gotta shoot two hands
You get hit with this heat and you catchin' a tan
Get low from the scene and then we get at his mans
We hop out the V and then hop back in the van (Where you going?)
Put the shmoney on him and get shmurda if we can't get to him
Knocks in my pockets, I walk with a limp
Bro called tryna score but he done off the rims
He lookin at me like I know my hands on the grip, look
He make a wrong move and I lift him, like
If my mans don't get hype, Sha pop out the cut he gon' blitz him
Took a pic and that boy did the same shit, I pop out and you know who I came with
Your mans died, nigga, go and slide, he just posting pictures while it's rainin' (Pussy)
Red dot to his face tryna off him, how they kids want to slide cause I'm tossin'
I know they mad and they picture me dead, but I picture they big homie walkin'
I been 90 before I was one, we ain't spin, push the back to the front
They see us broke, then I aim and they run, spin again if bro miss till he touched
Red beam, how the fuck can I miss? (How the fuck can I miss?)
I extended my clip, like
And yeah I heard the diss (I heard the diss), talkin' all this gun shit with no hits, like
He got shot and took it on the hop,
25 to the L if I get hit, like
He came home and had a kid with two thots, I see him, I'm throwin' and kickin' his kid, like
Gunsmoke we want all that (All that, all that)
Yeah, that's them in the V, know I'm on that
Justo, wait to shoot I'm like fall back
Fuck that, grrt-da-baow now he off that, look
Hit you up then go look for who sent you
Bloody face, ski mask when I bend through, look
See a crowd but he back out the 9
I'm aimin' for you and whoever you next to, like"
Bas,Happier by Marshmello & Bastille,"[Intro: Bastille]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
[Verse 1: Bastille]
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends
[Chorus: Bastille]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave
[Post-Chorus: Bastille]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
[Verse 2: Bastille]
When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together, at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made
[Chorus: Bastille]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave
[Post-Chorus: Bastille]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier[Bridge: Bastille]
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
[Pre-Chorus: Bastille]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
Even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier
[Chorus: Bastille]
Then only for a minute (Only for a minute)
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me (Right to me)
I wanna raise your spirits (Wanna raise your spirits)
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave
[Post-Chorus: Bastille]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

I was left to my own devices
Many days fell away with nothing to show
[Pre-Chorus]
And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love
Grey clouds roll over the hills, bringing darkness from above

But if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like you've been here before?
How am I going to be an optimist about this?
How am I going to be an optimist about this?

We were caught up and lost in all of our vices
In your pose as the dust settled around us

And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love
Grey clouds roll over the hills, bringing darkness from above

But if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like you've been here before?

Bas,"Costa Rica by Dreamville, Bas & JID (Ft. Buddy, Guapdad 4000, Jace, Mez, Reese LAFLARE, Ski Mask the Slump God & Smokepurpp)","[Chorus: J. Cole]
Soldier's song, marching on, on
Hoping to see home
If I die before I
See your smile just one more time
[Verse: J. Cole]
Sometimes I question whether this shit matters
Puttin' substance into something in a world so used to instant gratification
I found this instrumental on my phone while on vacation
Ib sent it a year ago or so
I probably heard it before, but slept on it, you know?
Shit don't always connect as soon as you press play
At times you gotta step away, do some livin'
Let time provide a new prescription, givin' truer vision
I dibble-dabble in a few religions
My homie constantly telling me 'bout Quran, puttin' me on
I read a few pages and recognize the wisdom in it
But I ain't got the discipline for stickin' with it
Now I'm on the way to London, got a show for seven digits
I'm wonderin' just when did I become my biggest critic?
I wanna be my biggest fan, like how I was when didn't nobody know my jams
Today my son said, ""Dad, let go my hand""
Reminded me one day he's gonna be his own man
And my job is to make sure he's equipped
I gotta make sure he not no bitch 'cause niggas bound to try him
If I said I was the toughest growin' up, I would be lyin'
I had a fear of gettin' punched while everybody eyein'
Add to that a constant fear of dyin'
By gunshot wound, the other violent type of endings
I kept a tough demeanor on the surface but was mostly just pretendin'
Luckily my bluff was workin' way more often than not
But sometimes a nigga pulled my card, tryna expose me for a fraud
And with my reputation at stake
I was scufflin' just to save face
Couple wins, couple losses, some broken up too quick to call it
My last scrap was with Puff Daddy, who would've thought it?
I bought that nigga album in seventh grade and played it so much
You would've thought my favorite rapper was Puff
Back then I ain't know shit, now I know too much
Ignorance is bliss and innocence is just ignorance before it's introduced to currency and clips
Or bad licks that have a nigga servin' three to six, shit
[Chorus: J. Cole, Bas & 6LACK]
Soldier's song, marching on, on
Hoping to see home
If I die before I
See your smile just one more time
[Bridge: Bas]
Soldier's song
I could be one to lean on
Time will right the wrongs
Won't be long
How can we grow any closer?
How can we grow any closer?
How can we grow any closer?
How can we grow any closer?
Something inside of me's tryna crawl up to the surface
Something is suddenly smothering, stopping me
Stubbornly getting its way (Way), way (Way)
Drowning out the wave (Drowning out)
I've got a reason to believe that I'll turn out just fine
Soldier's song
[Outro: Diddy]
Lord, please guide our steps
Watch us, cover us
So that every move we make is in alignment with Your will
Your purpose
Please fill us with Your spirit
Keep us forever in the present
For presence makes the strongest fathers
Teach us how to lead
Show us how to love"
Bas,Mood Swings by Pop Smoke (Ft. Lil Tjay),"[Verse 1: Marc E. Bassy]
Girl you party all the time
Don't let me stay on your mind
Adderall and cheap wine
Just to stay awake in conversation
We were always so damn insecure
So how could we ever know for sure
And disregard the way I know we feel
That would make this city way too real
[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me
We’re just strangers in passing casually
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me
[Verse 2: Marc E. Bassy]
The shirt on my back with the rips
Gems in my golden necklace
You didn't give me none of this
There's nothing for me to miss
We were too young on the day we met
How could we say we would not forget
And in the shadows there's a place for us
Somewhere hidden they can't find our love
Don't let 'em know
[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me
We’re just strangers in passing casually
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me
[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Eazy, and these days it's just you and me
This shit is dead and gone, it's not what it used to be
Someone give a eulogy
Know I'm hard headed and I might of acted foolishly
But you the one to hold us down usually
We was in a limbo
But of all people you ain't have to fuck with him though
That was my homie I had gave y'all the intro
Some things fall apart and some get thrown out the window
Remember when we first met we might've been too young
But we was from The Bay so we both was going too dumb
I used to be the one for you now you got a new one
So till the next lifetime, maybe we can do some'n
Eazy[Hook: Marc E. Bassy]
If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me
We’re just strangers in passing casually
It’s not us no more It’s just you and me

[Куплет 1]
Делай вопреки, делай от руки
Мир переверни, небо опрокинь
В каждом наброске, в каждом черновике
Учитель продолжается в своём ученике
Всю мою жизнь я иду ко дну
Всю мою жизнь я искал любовь, чтобы любить одну
Они сказали, нас поздно спасать и поздно лечить
Плевать, ведь наши дети будут лучше, чем мы
Лучше, чем мы
Лучше, чем мы
[Припев]
Когда меня не станет, я буду петь голосами
Моих детей и голосами их детей
Нас просто меняют местами
Таков закон Сансары — круговорот людей
Ой, мама
Когда меня не станет, я буду петь голосами
Моих детей и голосами их детей
Нас просто меняют местами
Таков закон Сансары — круговорот людей
Ой, мама
[Куплет 2]
Нас не стереть, мы живём назло
Пусть не везёт, но мы своё возьмём
Это небо — вместо сцены, здесь всё вверх ногами
И эти звёзды в темноте — тобой зажжённый фонарик
Тысяча меня до меня и после меня будет
Тысяча меня и в тысячах не меня — тыща меня
И мы снова вдребезги и нас не починить
Плевать, ведь наши дети будут лучше, чем мы
Лучше, чем мы
Лучше, чем мы
[Припев]
Когда меня не станет, я буду петь голосами
Моих детей и голосами их детей
Нас просто меняют местами
Таков закон Сансары — круговорот людей

Когда меня не станет, я буду петь голосами
Моих детей и голосами их детей
Нас просто меняют местами

I think I made it, I think I made it
'Cause I'm always smiling, and you are the reason now
Girl, I can't explain it
It's all in the timing, I had to get low
I had to get low
I had to get back, I had to report
I had to get facts 'cause you are just that, you that
Girl, you share your truths with me
And I find them true, a muse, you in the booth with me
[Verse 1: Bas]
Can't spend no time on the nickle and dime'n
I got me a girl, she don't want no diamonds
A daily reminder to holla at God
Like ""Where did you find her? Good looking, my nigga""
Everything 'round me I took it
Did it with only the niggas I knew
And a few niggas I thought I knew better
There go my bitches, I always do better
But, you're more top echelon
My next probably be a step backwards
Niggas front when they get struck with love
Like the drama majors, be the best actors
I'm done with all that tough acting
John Madden would've saw it happen, and so it happens
My niggas want life's good things, they still dreaming
And you deserve 'em too, I'ma do it just so it happens

Sometimes I feel jaded
They don't see the real me
They only know Cole, they only know Co-ole
I had to get back, I had to resort to turning my back
I'm doing just that, true that
I thought He was through with me, but that wasn't true
The proof? You in the coupe with me
God shuffled the cards, dealt me a hand with impossible odds
Put an obstacle course up
Look, and I conquered them all (Conquered them all)
With minimal effort I'm fresher than sock in your drawer (Fuck)
They spinning my records so heavy, I'm topping the Forbes
Stuck in a rock and a hard place though
Is it true what they say? The higher you go, the longer the fall?
Well, I dropped to the floor, the knock at the door was on cue
Uh, I thought that I saw it all 'til I saw you
Now I call you when the sun shines and the rain dries up
I'm a pit bull, but for you I be on chain tied up
(One more time)
In the backyard with a muzzle on tail wagging like Oregon Trail
Waiting on you to come through just like you do, well[Chorus: Bas & J. Cole]

For you to even touch my skill
You gotta go through one killer bee and he ain't gonna kill
Now chop that down, pass it all around
Lyrics get hard quick cement to the ground
For any emcee in any fifty-two states
I get psycho killer, Norman Bates
My producer slam my flow is like bam
Jump on stage and then I dip down
(I like the way you talk)
Yo, y'all know the lyrics, come on, sing with me
[Chorus 1]
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it raw
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it raw

Bas,All About That Bass by Meghan Trainor,"[Intro]
“So, what would you little maniacs like to do first?”
[Refrain]
Watching through my fingers
Watching through my fingers
[Verse 1]
Shut my eyes and count to ten
It goes in one ear out the other, oh
One ear out the other, oh
Burning bright right 'til the end
Now you’ll be missing from the photographs
Missing from the photographs
[Refrain]
Watching through my fingers
Watching through my fingers
[Verse 2]
In my thoughts you’re far away
And you are whistling a melody
Whistling a melody
Crystallizing clear as day
Oh I can picture you so easily
Picture you so easily
[Pre-Chorus]
What’s gonna be left of the world if you’re not in it?
What’s gonna be left of the world? Oh
[Chorus]
Every minute and every hour
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more
Every stumble and each misfire
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more
[Refrain]
Watching through my fingers
Watching through my fingers
[Verse 3]
Caught off guard by your favourite song
Oh I’ll be dancing at a funeral
Dancing at a funeral
Sleeping in the clothes you love
It’s such a shame we had to see them burn
Shame we had to see them burn[Pre-Chorus]
What’s gonna be left of the world if you’re not in it?
What’s gonna be left of the world, oh
[Chorus]
Every minute and every hour
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more
Every stumble and each misfire
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more
[Interlude]
If you want to be a party animal, you have to learn to live in the jungle
Now stop worrying and go get dressed
[Bridge]
You might have to excuse me
I’ve lost control of all my senses
And you might have to excuse me
I’ve lost control of all my words
So get drunk, call me a fool
Put me in my place, put me in my place
Pick me up, up off the floor
Put me in my place, put me in my place
[Chorus]
Every minute and every hour
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more
Every stumble and each misfire
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more[Refrain]
Watching through my fingers
Watching through my fingers
[Outro]
Cause every minute and every hour
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more"
Bas,Pompeii by Bastille,"[Intro: Sample]
Do you still believe in love?
Or do you like drugs?
[Verse 1: Bas]
Ran into a night owl rollin' White Owls
Girl it's been awhile since I hit a White Owl
I'm with it though, she a centerfold
Big ol' blunt look like tentacles
She strip in Europe, Interpol
Don't remember her in her clothes
I fucked her friend, damn they was close
Let's reunite, let's get em close
Hit 'em twice in a row, hit a flight, and I'm ghost
That's the last time I seen her though
She be gettin' too eager, ho
Stamp it like it's my visa
Cheefin' off of these berries
When the world gets heavy and it hurts to carry
I'm her Midnight Mercenary, Fiend
[Chorus: Bas]
It's lit, feel the buzz?
That's a half? Shit it was
It's lit, feel the buzz?
It's lit, feel the buzz?
[Verse 2: Bas]
She take me to a place that I never would discover
Might never have another, so I had to fuck her
Reach into my pockets, damn I ain't got a rubber
See my nigga Ron like L. Ron Hubbard, he be outta space
Say he got a case of straps at the back of the hotel cupboard
Room 508, check by the safe, she say ""Boy you got it made
Do you got a cape?"", I ain't with the games ma, do I gotta wait?
I'm quite impatient, intoxication got me feelin' like procreating
Girl I'm the baker, you surely caking
Stand back, catch my amazing graces
Photo finish and fornication
Photo finish and fornication, fiend
[Chorus: Bas]
It's lit, feel the buzz?
That's a half? Shit it was
It's lit, feel the buzz?
It's lit, feel the buzz?[Bridge: KQuick]
Feel the buzz
Can you feel the buzz?
Feel the buzz, ohh-whoa, yeah
Do you believe in love?
What's your drug? What's your drug?
Ohh-whoa
[Interlude: J. Cole]
Take it all the way from the beginning
Yea, yea, yea
Now comes the question of which intro do you use?
Do you use this intro or the other intro I was talkin' on?
But, then that lets people know I had more than one take
So maybe we should just not use this and use the other intro
So people would think I just took it straight through
Yea, let's do that...
[Verse 3: J. Cole]
You'd be surprised how many truths you can hide in flows
I'm listenin' to this beat with my eyelids closed
Thoughts keep flashin' and I keep laughin
I never thought that I would fuck Irish hoes
Maybe Asian bitches or Caucasian bitches
Remember when I got to New York I was lost
Because all I ever saw was Jamaican bitches
I ain't barely know what Jamrock was
Lil' country nigga God damn I was
To you niggas talkin online until you make it this high
Then you could never understand this buzz, well
Maybe if you put yourself in the shoes
Of a nigga comin' straight out the South
No gold grill just a east coast feel
And a set of crooked teeth in his mouth
Make them hoes bounce, that can't get enough
Niggas say I made it I ain't make it enough
Man hang that nigga, you a real lame ass nigga
If you ain't got my tape in your truck
Cole, um world don't you forget that
I think I lost my mind round the same time I lost my six pack
But no sit-ups for me
, long as my dick still get up for me
Long as a ho still give up for me
She usually charge but she get us for free
Woah, that's TMI, lil' something like TMZ
Scared of the days you'll be seeing me
Cause my girl do not play, coach DNP
That's something for the hoop fans
Just copped her the coupe man
No drop top but a slot on the roof that can slide out
And get a little sun while you ride out
Ced on the beat let me vibe out
We was 15 with a ASR up in my house
Writin' rhymes out, momma made it happen
Could've been a lawyer but I made it rappin'
He made it rappin', now at the shows he the main attraction
Another shot of Henny so I'm faded askin'
How long do this drug called fame be lastin'?
(It's lit, feel the buzz?)
Another shot of Henny so I'm faded askin'
How long do this drug called fame be lastin'?
That's deep[Outro: Bas]
Feel the buzz?
It's lit, feel the buzz?
Feel the buzz?"

Nicki Minaj,"Only by Nicki Minaj (Ft. Chris Brown, Drake & Lil Wayne)","[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo
I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake
On my life, man, fuck's sake
If I did, I'd ménage with 'em
And let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate
I don't duck nobody but tape
Yeah, that was a setup
For a punchline on duct tape
Wo-wo-wo-worried 'bout if my butt fake
Worry 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
Th-these girls are my sons
Jo-Jon & Kate Plus Eight
When I walk in, sit up straight
I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5
Is my idea of a update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two
Big titties, big butt too
Fu-fuck with them real niggas
Who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is
Ri-ring finger where the rock is
The-these hoes couldn't test me
Even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with
Ma-ma-mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens
Unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in
Like seasoning
And tell them bitches blow me
Lance Stephenson

Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July

Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only
[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, I never fucked Nicki 'cause she got a man
But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought, ""Goddamn, this is the perfect time""
We had just come from that video
You know, L.A. traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt, but I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, low-key or maybe high-key
I been peeped that you like me, you know?
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that's right, I like my girls BBW
Yeah, type that wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh! Yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad-ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you, oh
That's 'cause I believe in something, I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever tryna fuck
Just give me the heads-up, so I can plan for it

If I did fuck, she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
'Cause she act like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story-teller
I piss greatness, like goldish yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she waved
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy,
treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' 'bout runnin' in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, masked up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga
I mean brazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the ""b"" off behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off, I blow your face off
I mean ""pop-pop-pop,"" then I take off
Nigga, now you see me, nigga, now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx acting like Ray Charles
Sixteen in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with seventeen bullets
My story is how I went from ""poor me""
To ""please pour me a drink and celebrate with me""[Chorus: Chris Brown & Lil Wayne]

But if he can't fuck three times a night, peace!
I tried to fuck 50 for a powerful hour
But all that nigga wanna do is talk Power for hours
B-beat the pussy up, make sure it's a K-O
Step your banks up like you're movin' that yayo
Somebody go and make sure Karrueche okay, though
I heard she think I'm tryna give the coochie to Quavo
They always wanna beat it up, goon up the pussy
Man, maybe I should let him autotune up the pussy
All these Bow Wow Challenge niggas lyin' and shit
Man, these Fetty Wap niggas stay eyein' my shit
Drake worth a hundred mill, he always buyin' me shit
But I don't know if the pussy wet or if he cryin' and shit
Meek still be in my DMs, I be havin' to duck him
""I used to pray for times like this"" face-ass when I fuck him
Man, Uzi is my baby, he ain't takin' a L
But he took it literally when I said ""Go to hell""
Used to fuck with Young Thug, I ain't addressin' this shit

On the, on the real, I should make these niggas scrap for the pussy
Young M.A and Lady Luck, get the strap for this pussy, uh
And I woulda had Odell Beckham bangin' the cake
'Til I saw him hoppin' out of cars dancin' to Drake

Had to cancel DJ Khaled, boy, we ain't speakin'
Ain't no fat nigga tellin' me what he ain't eatin'
YG and The Game with the hammer yellin', ""Gang! Gang!""
This ain’t what I meant when I said a gang bang

He done bodied everybody, in closing, these bitches losin'
Usin', usin' up, a bitch movin'
No, I ain't stuttered and no, I ain't Ruben
Damn, a bitch snoozin'
Shoutout to my Jews, l'chaim, Rick Rubin

Uh, thinkin' out loud
I must have a quarter million on me right now
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm about it, talkin' blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women, are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rollin' and they mood change
Like a muhfucka
New flow, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you a undercover
I could probably make some step-sisters fuck each other (Woo)
Talkin' filets with the truffle butter
Fresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it
Yeah, they all get what they desire from it
What, tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it

Yo, thinkin' out loud
I must have about a milli on me right now
And I ain't talkin' about that Lil Wayne record
I'm still the highest sellin' female rapper, for the record
Man, this a 65 million single sold
I ain't gotta compete with a single soul
I'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll
Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul
Pretty women, wassup? Is you here right now?
You a stand-up or is you in your chair right now?
Uhh, do you hear me? I can't let a wack nigga get near me
I might kiss the baddest bitch if you dare me
I ain't never need a man to take care of me
Yo, I'm in that big boy, bitches can't rent this
I floss everyday, but I ain't a dentist
Your whole style and approach, I invented
And I ain't takin' that back, cause I meant it[Chorus: Maya Jane Coles]

Uh, thinkin' out loud
I could be broke and keep a million dollar smile
LOL to the bank, check in my account
Bank teller flirtin' after checkin' my account
Pretty ladies, are you here? Truffle butter on your pussy
Cuddle buddies on the low, you ain't gotta tell your friend
That I eat it in the morning, cause she gon' say ""I know""
Can I hit it in the bathroom? Put your hands on the toilet
I'll put one leg on the tub, girl, this my new dance move
I just don't know what to call it
But, bitch, you dancing with the stars
I ain't nothin' like your last dude
What's his name? — Not important
I brought some cocaine if you snortin'
She became a vacuum, put it on my dick like carpet
Suck the white off, white chocolate
I'm so heartless, thoughtless, lawless, and flawless
Smallest, regardless, largest in charge
And born in New Orleans, get killed for Jordans
Skateboard, I'm gnarly, Drake, Tunechi, and Barbie

Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Bi-big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bo-bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had them pushing daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit

By the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, and I hit him with the jab like

He toss my salad like his name Romaine
And when we done, I make him buy me Balmain
I'm on some dumb shit

Bitch ain't comin' off the bench
While I'm comin' off the court fully drenched
Here go some haterade, get ya thirst quenched
Styled on 'em in this Burberry trench
These birds copy every word, every inch
But gang gang got the hammer and the wrench (Brrr)
I pull up in that quarter milli off the lot
Oh, now she tryna be friends like I forgot
Show off my diamonds like I'm signed by the Roc (By the rock)
Ain't pushin' out his babies 'til he buy the rock

I went and copped the chopsticks, put it in my bun just to pop shit
I'm always in the top shit, box seats, bitch, fuck the gossip

You play checkers, couldn't beat me playin' chess
Now I'm about to turn around and beat my chest
Bitch, it's King Kong, yes, it's King Kong
Bitch, it's King Kong, this is King Kong
Chinese ink on, Siamese links on

Bitch, it's King Kong, yes, I'm King Kong
This is King Kong? Yes, Miss King Kong
In my kingdom wit' my Timbs on
How many championships? What? Six rings on

'Cause I don't need no, fraud
I don't no, drama when you call
I don't need no, lies

I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up

Aye yo, throw your wrist-es up, all my bitches up
These niggas is pussier than what? All them dicks is up
All my real niggas down to ride, throw your GSXRs up
I ain't in the projects, but all my bricks is up, rrrr
You can't be Pablo if your work ain't sellin'
What the fuck is this bitch inhalin'?
I woulda helped you out that pit you fell in
I am the generous queen! Ask Ms. Ellen
Tried to drop ""Another One"", you was itchin' to scrap
You exposed your ghostwriter, now you wish it was scrapped
Heard your pussy on yuck, I guess you needed a Pap
What type of bum bitch shoot a friend over a rack?
What type of mother leave her one son over a stack?
Lil Boogie down basic bitch thinkin' she back
Back to back, oh you mean, back to wack?
""Back to Back""? Me and Drizzy laughed at that
They say numbers don't matter but when they discussin' the kings
They turn around and say Lebron ain't got six rings
I never signed a 360, bitch you wild dumb
That's why Jay ain't clear his verse for your album
Sheneneh, you a fraud committin' perjury
I got before and after pictures of your surgery
Rah took you to her doc, but you don't look like Rah
Left the operating table, still look like ""nah""[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]

Why do niggas that are not involved love to get involved?
Why do niggas claim the streets and act just like the law?
Riddles that I cannot seem to solve, man
Cristal, come at me, Weezy F and Nick
All come and spoke about your shit in '15
Man, I know you niggas saw this one comin'
My net worth sound like grrrrrr
But they don't pay in cash
Niggas see me like, ""What up, Killa?""
Man, please stop bringin' up my past
I'd really love to leave that behind
Sometimes I ask God, ""Man, why him?""
Like the team that I would never leave behind
I really gotta ease off the wine
Which is funny because I just saw Nick the other day
And she keeps getting finer over time

Blunt be tight as biker shorts, twisted like some handlebars
Lil' Tune out a cartoon or Avatar
I just looked in the mirror like, ""Alright, alright, alright""
I would let that little nigga right there fuck my wife, word
I don't need no fraud bitches in and out my life, word
In and out my pockets and then in and out of sight, word
I don't need no drama, I just need some nana

Cupid's never been mistaken
See, I been caught up in the moment
Shit, my type ain't quite her type but now this gangsta nigga on it
She can twist my weed and hit the 'yac
I can hit your type without the hat, put that pussy on the map
I see qualities in a bad girl,
I know that ass you got
Come with attitude and your swag, girl, you ain't wrong, girl
Just when that door knock lose your thong, girl
'Cause you girl, 'cause you girl, girl, 'cause you girl, girl
'Cause you girl, girl...
[Chorus: BJ the Chicago Kid]
I'm just sittin' in the studio just tryna get to you, baby
But this song so fuckin' dope, girl, it's harder not for me to blaze it
To tell the truth, wish it was you in this booth that I was blazin'
So I'm just sittin' in the studio just tryna get to you, baby
[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Throw a loc your pussy, girl, you knowing that your nigga faded
Can I hit that pussy way I wanna while this record playing?
Put my tongue in different places, play a game of Operation
Uh, like, na-na-na, la-la, la-la,
you get what I'm saying
No metaphors, nothing like that
I'm keeping it straight to the point with you
So, I'ma put this dick up all in-side-of-you[Chorus: BJ the Chicago Kid]
I'm just sittin' in the studio just tryna get to you, baby
But this song so fuckin' dope, girl, it's harder not for me to blaze it
To tell the truth, wish it was you in this booth that I was blazin'
So I'm just sittin' in the studio just tryna get to you, baby
I'm just sittin' in the studio just tryna get to you, baby
But this song so fuckin' dope, girl, it's harder not for me to blaze it
To tell the truth, wish it was you in this booth that I was blazin'
So I'm just sittin' in the studio just tryna get to you, baby"

Life for me is just weed and brews

Am I over-faded? Hell yeah it's true
Turn a beat on, ain't no limit to what I can do
See this Top Dawg in heat, but I'ma fuck the world
I'ma be on tunes 'til God re-furls
You sat me down, I'm still tryna get higher
You looked at me stupid when I twisted the fire
Meanwhile my nigga drunk as fuck
A nigga fucked up, we all fucked up
You done fucked up, I brought more blunts
Smoke back to up, you niggas know what's up
Too damn high, can't stand myself

ScHoolboy Q,Blessed by ScHoolboy Q (Ft. Kendrick Lamar),"[Intro]
What is life for a nigga like me?
Living out his backpack every night
Needed a new place to sleep
But this is now, nigga
[Verse 1]
One's for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready cause I feel I finally did it
Four's for the jealous rapper mad because he finished
Turn that mothafucka to a critic
Man, I got so much shit up on my plate, dog
I was hanging on them corners late
Pockets wasn't straight, bitch
I ain't gon' make it at this rate, dog, know what I'm saying?
Nigga praying up to God just hoping that he hear a nigga
I know the world got more problems and it's much bigger
But I figured, I'd get some shit up off my chest
To all my niggas I would die for, load my pistol up, go out and war for
To all my niggas that'll never make it out the streets
Fuck it, keep goin' hard, don't let 'em see you weak
To all my niggas first time stepping in the pen
Read a book and exercise, keep your spirit in
To all my niggas that's gon' fuck around and die today
Take our hats off, bow our heads and let us pray, just wanna say
[Chorus]
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga, ah
[Verse 2]
Now how the fuck I'm 'posed to say this?
You see my nigga just lost his son
While I'm here hugging on my daughter, I grip her harder
Kiss her on the head as I cry for a bit
Thinking of some bullshit to tell him
Like ""It'll be okay, you'll be straight, it'll be aight""
Well, fuck that shit
Whatever you need, yo, I got it!
Whether it's money or some weed or putting in work
Fuck it, then I'm riding
You know what's up, but now a nigga couldn't stick around
Told myself that after y'all moved
That I'd be a fuckin' fool, to be living by the street rules
""Fuck police"" tattoos, that happens when you ditch school
But anyway, keep the faith
Stay strong, bruh, remain solid, bruh
Keep playing ball, cuz
It's the only way up out it, bruh,
a nigga proud of ya
Tell Floyd to enjoy his newborn seed
I'll have whatever he needs,
we the last of a dying breed
Live life, smoke trees
See how far we've come but most, I'm sorry for your son[Chorus]
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga, ah

And you ain't gotta shed no tear
I'll be everywhere but I'ma always be right here
I ain't forgot those years
I'll be everywhere but I'ma always be right here
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & ScHoolboy Q]
Living in a premature place, wait
Never grow to see the pearly gates,
break
Every time a bullet detonate, dates
Of obituary carry crates
Of a scary picture with a family member that relate to ya
In December you was finna pin another case
On your record in a stolen Expedition, play it safe
As the record spinning, you was hearing angels entertain
Every pun intended, that was wicked, coming from your brain
Recognize you listened and you didn't hit the block again
That's because the minute after you had knew you would be slain
Open up another chapter in the book and read 'gain
Story of a gun-clapper really tryna make a change
Everybody ain't blessed, my nigga
Yes, my nigga, you're blessed, take advantage, do your best, my nigga
Don't stress,
you was granted everything inside this planet
Anything you imagine, you possess, my nigga
You reject these niggas that neglect your respect
For the progress of a baby step, my nigga
Step-step my nigga, one, two, skip-skip
Back-back, look both ways, pull it off the hip
Blast at anybody say that you can't flip
This crack into rap music every other zip is a track
Get used to it, get it off quick
Come back, give back to the city you've built
That's that, don't trip, see money, fuck niggas, dog
It ain't nothing but a bunch of fuck niggas, dog
In a minute everybody gon' be winning
Put a little faith in it then recognize that we all[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga, ah

ScHoolboy Q,Break the Bank by ScHoolboy Q,"[Verse 1]
Fuck rap, I've been rich, crack by my stick shift
Oxy like concerts, always my bread first
""Get Mine"" my nickname, O-X and cocaine
Nina my new thing, blew up before fame
Heart filled with octane, fire in my soul
Burn through my shoestring, came up from boosting
Du-rags and flatlines,
drive-bys at bedtime
Get down, I heard mom, someone lost they grandson
Thank God that I'm straight, no wonder my mom prayed
Lost one of my cuzzos, cursed from them devils
Good weed and me time, goodbye to Nissan
Cause one day this rappin' gon' pay
[Chorus]
So now we 'bout to break the bank
Money be on my mind
Niggas talkin' 'bout, soundin' like
La-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do
Now we 'bout to break the bank
Money be on my mind

Now we 'bout to break the bank
[Verse 2]
My time to show out,
finally the illest Crip
And I guarantee, I spit harder than concrete
Surprised I got teeth,
my lungs inhale keef
Peyote with THC, swinging for the fence
I hope I make it out the park, where the baseheads slide
After dark, where the bangers get caught
Hid the gun in the trees, arrest me by the court
I just wanna smoke weed and sip lean by the quart, for real
Good weed, I hit that, crack rock, I sold that
Oxy, I hid that, right by my nutsack
Fuck pigs, I bust back, learned that from Deuce rat
Peanut and B-loon, had gats before racks
Way 'fore I found rap, bitch, I had them things wrapped
Astro on my cap,
this shot ain't no phone app
Chucks on my young heel, make sure that my sag ill
Learn my set trip grill, trade in my big wheel
Good grades and skipped school,
this life gon' catch up soon
Sure 'nough that shit did, twenty-year-old kid
Got off my behind, write me some sweet lines
Cause one day my story gon' pay
[Chorus]
So now we 'bout to break the bank

Your bitch wanted cash, get her, know I'm around, boy
Tell Kendrick, move from the throne, I came for it
I hope this fuckin' hit arrange for it, cause goddamn

What you talkin' 'bout if it ain't 'bout the money?
Neck full of gold, I'm attracted to the honey
Rain, sleet, snow, 'bout the money
On Figueroa, close your eyes, might need ya mommy
[Verse 3]
Fuck rap, my shit real, came up off them pills
Hustle for my meal, grindin' for my deal
Love how I'm doin', long way from grooving
Bitch call me 2 Chainz, units be moving
Go hard for my Joy, so she don't need no boy
Smile stay on her face, big room with her own space
Up all night, the hard way, don't care if it take all day
I let y'all fucks parler, you wonder why I'm straight
New shoes and sick clothes, bitches be front row
Bow down her temple, I don't know her info
Threw up my peace sign,
go rare with my mignon
Cause one day this rappin' gon' pay

[Intro: ScHoolboy Q]
This the shit that they need
Tell me where are you from
Drop your pants to your knees
Girl, I'm capital G
[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Might pull up in my bucket
This nine holds a good dozen
Might slide up in your cousin
Just made a mil' and still thuggin'
Niggas banged on me but they should've shot me
See, I hit the corner then spot him, got him
Court date, but I skipped the bail
Rather wig myself before I sit in jail
Need a gang of weed and a pint of lean
Got a hat say Figg' on my gangsta tip
Don't trust no ho, I might sock the bitch
I'm apocalypse to your politics
Might cop the Phantom, get ghost
I can pay your bills with this coat
Need an extra band for this smoke
I can see for miles with this scope, nigga
Got an oxy-scribed to this dope dealer
Misses Piggy, want a piggyback
Rock cremation, then called it crack
I'mma keep on eating 'til my ankles fat
Sell that fix, throw it cross the map
Push my penis in between her lap
Put my semen all down her throat
'Til Tito kilos come off that boat
[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
This the shit that they want
This the shit that they need
Tell me where are you from?

Yeah, this that four niggas in a Regal flow
Speeding through the yellow lights
Treat my Versace belt like it's a mistletoe
I put everything over yellow rice
Graduated from hella ice
If I stand on my bankroll (stand on your bankroll)
Nigga, I'd be scared of heights
And I'd be dodging the po-lice
When I was poor with no lights
When I was poor with potential
Watch my flow in four inches
Oh Lord, she in Christians
All gold for my Adventist
Pulled it down and she kissed it
All gold where my wrists is
God'll judge, no conviction
Just because I got dreads don't get it twisted
Moving my whip down the boulevard
Word 'round town, I was selling hard
Hard and I'm talking bout the yayo
Hit her on the floor and then I lay low
Amigos say ""Que pasa with the pesos?""
Promethazine codeine, caseloads
(T.R.U.)
And when I pull up to the valet
You know I got the strippers on payroll![Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]

This that shit that's Iraq

This that shit you just bought
This that Q go hamhawk
This that car that won't park
Pedal to floor, it won't stop
And just when you thought it won't drop
Oxymoron in stores
Come in, kids, lock the door
Knock-knock-knock, hit the floor
Need my bread off the top
Could buy anything off the lot
This that steel, not the grill
Get them slugs off for real
This that curl with the gel
We gon' win, smoke the L's
She love my mic, rock the bell
Leave that punani killed
All them hoes run to Q
Spit that truth,

Spent 2 bills on my socks

Try to beat me there, let me be clear
Is you eatin' ass too? Nigga, pinky swear
I'm just lookin' for a dude, that could eat the twat
Do he make more dough, than the pizza shop?
Do he dress every day, like it's Easter Sunday?
Can he give me more head, than Peggy Bundy?
Man, fuck I look like turnin' down some dome?
Man that's sorta like a dog turnin' down some bone
Nigga know that I'm a 10, that's Celine on my lens
I don't need another friend, it's just me and my Ms
I said, ""What you like about me?"" He said, ""That your ass fat""
He said, ""Would I let him eat this ice cream out my ass crack?""
He said that it's abstract, he said, ""Yo, yo ass crack!""

Subtractin' the negative energy
Fuck with the family, turn your ass to a memory
My niggas keep it a century
I blow the check up, nigga, detonation
Kill 'em one by one, Final Destination
Top my destination
I got guardian angels all around a nigga, that's deflectin' Satan
I'm a mothafuckin' champion
This right here the fuckin' anthem
I can't dap you without hand san'
I don't know where your dirty ass hands been
I wake up to like a hundred texts
Championship team, but we can't cut the net
She all off in my jersey lookin' underdressed
I'm finna buy this bitch a Honda CRX
With...
[Chorus: Travis Scott & Desiigner]
1500, all in singles (straight up!)
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round it go, 'round and 'round it go
'Round and 'round they go
I'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole
Than to get down in a hole[Verse 5: 2 Chainz]
I took a nap in the pulpit
I never like how a suit fit
I got a pocket full of money
It got me walkin' all slew-foot
I'm on my wave like a cruise ship
In that ho mouth like a toothpick
Anyone get in my way
Nothin' to say, I tote 'em choppas like pool sticks
I wear pajamas to Ruth's Chris
Couldn't walk a mile in my new kicks
I'm comin' from the apartments
We never had our damn pool fixed
Walk in the mall with my new bitch
Tell her to get the whole rack
My new bitch gon' pull me a new bitch
Then pull me a new bitch
See that is a snowball effect
I got gold on my neck
Lookin' like a Super Bowl on my neck
I got a mansion full of marble floors
It look like I could go bowl in this bitch
Versace logos on bowls in this bitch
Like I'm a serial killer
I put the real in gorilla
I did this shit for my niggas
[Chorus: Travis Scott & Desiigner]
1500, all in singles (straight up!)
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round it go, 'round and 'round it go
'Round and 'round they go
I'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole
Than to get down in a hole
Champions, we run the city
Number one, they fallin' from the top
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round it go, 'round and 'round it go
'Round and 'round they go
I'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole
Than to get down in a hole
[Verse 6: Yo Gotti]
I'm Yo Gotti!
Reach for my chain is suicide
The car I drive fit two inside
They mad at Ye 'cause he all in the neighborhood
But he let them goons inside
Let's fuck up the neighborhood
Let's fuck up the neighborhood
Buy every house in this bitch
You know that the money good
My wrist in the kitchen go 'round and 'round
Play with the kid, I'ma gun you down
The roof on that Wraith in the lost and found
Official trap shit let me slow it down
Way more shit than a Pamper
All we rock is bandanas
Whips so nasty, no manners
I just got head in a Phantom
[Verse 7: Gucci Mane]
She say she don't want a chump, baby want a champ
She say money make her cum, Gucci make her damp (Gucci!)
1017's the Squad, Gucci Mane's the stamp
And he don't never sleep, he's a fuckin' vamp
I heard your bitch ride on the bus, you don't give a damn
My bitch drive a Lamb', you should call her ma'am
I love my Auntie Jane, but fuck Uncle Sam
I'm a walkin' money machine, check my Instagram
Niggas never test the kid so I don't have to cram
My city treat me like a king, I should wear a crown
And I don't really fuck around
I gave my bitch two mil' 'cause she stuck around
[Chorus: Travis Scott & Desiigner]
1500, all in singles (straight up!)
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round it go, 'round and 'round it go
'Round and 'round they go
I'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole
Than to get down in a hole
Champions, we run the city
Number one, they fallin' from the top
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round it go
'Round and 'round they go
I'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole

Yo Gotti,Doin 2 Much by Moneybagg Yo & Yo Gotti,"[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo]
I got a thang for bitches

Nine times out of ten I'm banging them bitches
All we do is fuck, but she say we don't do it enough
Calling my phone, going ham

Bitch thought she had a blessing
Ho lied like she pregnant
To tell the truth she was messy
Screenshotting our messages
I ain't gon' lie, I hit her a couple times
I really was thirsty though
She was just one of them bitches you hit four in the morning
Like come to the door
Crust in her eyes while she drive, she coming straight to me
She put that rachet pussy head on a nigga
I'm going straight to sleep
I tried to tell her fold it, she unfolded
I can't have fucking with you on my name
We started off cool and then the shit changed
I guess the good dick done fucked up her brain
Hold up, hold up, lil bitch you tripping out
Got a bitch at the house, you not my spouse
Without a doubt, I stopped fucking with you
Had to cut you off, like scissors will do
Ain't gon' lie, your lil action was clutch
But you just was doin' too much
Puttin' your friends on what we got going on
Bitch keep that on the hush

Yeat,The Second Coming by William Butler Yeats,"Turning and turning in the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Things fall apart
;
the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy
is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity.
Surely
some
revelation
is at hand;
Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out
When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
Troubles my sight:
somewhere in sands of the desert
A shape with lion body and the head of a man
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
Is moving its slow thighs,
while all about it
Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.
The darkness drops again, but now I know
That twenty centuries of stony sleep
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?"
Yeat,Sorry Bout That by Yeat,"[Intro]

She eat me up like it's Beni-bachi

She said she feel it now, I don't even feel it though
Bitch, I be high on these drugs every day of my life
I don't know at all if I should quit or not
How the fuck could I choose if this is bad for me
When everything goin' out sad on my life?
Bitch, I just got off the phone with my jeweler
That brand new Cuban link comin' in with diamonds
Yeah, and they just told me, if I bought the Tesla
I'm helpin' the climate so I'm finna pop a hundred
I'm on the Perc' so I call up my bae like, ""What's up with ya?""
She said, ""Can I pull up and lay up with ya?"" (Yeah)
She said, ""I wanna watch a movie if you get the picture"" (Ha)

She wanna lick my privates, all night (Let's go)
Just tell me, you gotta tell me the truth 'bout it, all it, yeah

I had the Issey Miyake jeans with the Arcteryx jacket
Yeah, and my lil' thot say that she addicted to me like some cracky
Yeah, she pull up, I'm breakin' her backy
These kids, they goofy, they wacky
I'm not a kid,
I'm a man like Pacqui
I already made a whole mil' off the rappin'
I used to vacuum seal the Za' and wrap it
Now all I think 'bout is the racks
Now I don't wanna hear about it if it ain't facts
She finna pull up, eat it like it's Beni-bachi (Pull up, eat it like it's Beni-bachi)

Bitch, you thirsty, please grab a Sprite
My Crips lurking, don't die tonight
I just want to dance with you, baby
Just don't move too fast, I'm too crazy
Man down, Downey Ave, it gets shady
Take a nigga mind off that
We can dip, fuck in the whip, slide right back in the function
One wrong word, start busting
Put that on my Yankee hat
I'm a gangsta Crip, fuck gangsta rap
Where the ladies at? Where the hoes? Where the bitches?
Every real nigga know the difference
Bandana brown like the dope daddy shooting in the kitchen
Real Norfside nigga, never went to Poly, Wilson, or Cabrillo
Cocaine color of a Creole
T-Skrap moving for the D-low, and he know
[Chorus]
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
From the city where the skinny carry strong heat
Norfside, Long Beach (Norfside, Long Beach)
[Verse 2]
Hit the corner, make a dollar flipping
Split the dollars with my mama children
Folks need Porsches, hoes need abortions
I just need y'all out of my business
Never no problem playing no bitches
Never no problem spraying no witnesses
No face, no case, been with the shit
Hopped out broad day, then emptied clips
Cut class 'cause it wasn't 'bout cash
School wasn't no fun, couldn't bring my gun
Know a change gon' come like Obama 'nem say
But they shooting everyday 'round my mama 'nem way
So we put an AK where Kiana and them stay
And that's for any nigga say he got a problem with me
How I'm Cripping where I'm living, come and follow me
Pistol popping, Poppy Street

I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
From the city where the skinny carry strong heat
Norfside, Long Beach (Norfside, Long Beach)[Verse 3]
Nate Dogg still here 'cause of niggas like me
Police still scared 'cause of niggas like me
In the hood, like a dollar sweet tea or a Louis Burger
You ain't with the business, nigga, who you murdered?
You ain't heard of Coldchain? Best thang smokin' out the city
Riding 'round with the same shotgun that shot Ricky
Lil' nigga should've zig-zagged, then he got his back wet
Naughty running Norfside, niggas better fact-check
Fronting with the gun talk, I ain't heard a clap yet
All my niggas from the street, they the niggas best yet
'Cept for Lil' Halftime, brody bang the Five Blocks
Sorry, I hit your homie five times, better grab chalk
Did it, got away with it out the Civic
We Cripping, Long Beach City, pay a visit
Park Ramona, Pop-block the corner
Giving hell 'til it's frozen over
I ain't never ran from nothing

I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police

Fuck your dead homies, run your bread, homie
Got some lead for me, I'm on Artesia
Parked in my Bimmer, bumping my own shit
I'm focused, they stuck on that old shit
Living for that True Religion is broke shit
I could spend that on a MAC with a long clip
Fly in that Benz, but you hide in that Focus
My nigga, just focus, I'm trying to paint you a picture
We stuck in the moment
My burner get stuck if I shoot it too much
So a nigga resorted to doming
That's somebody's son, but a war to be won
Baby, either go hunt or be hunted
We crabs in a bucket
He called me a crab, so I shot him in front of the Douglas
I cannot be fucked with, we thuggin' in public

What mean the world to you?
Is it fast life, money, and clothes?
Probably fucking these hoes?
Or what would you murder for?
Will your name hold weight when the curtains close?
Nigga caught one case, and I heard he told
Snitch get a full clip and closed casket
Won't hug your bitch when the ho ratchet
Cold jumper, been shooting, no practice
Been touring, whip foreign, coupe crashing
Still banging 2 Naughty 2 Nasty
Still ""fuck the police,"" they won't catch me
My feature too pricey, don't ask me
Go hard 'til Goyard on my baggage
He mad, we won't fight, I'm gon' tag him
Mask up at midnight and start clapping
Kids crying, still snipe him, no lacking[Chorus: Future]
Ayy, 9 millimeter, my brother's my keeper

Heaven sent a present my way

Packing everything when you leave
You know you coming back
Wanna see me down on my knees
But that was made for a ring
I try to wait for the storm to calm down
But that's stubborn, baby, leading to war
We droned down on each other
Tryin' to even the score
We all been found guilty in the court of aorta[Chorus: Billie Eilish]

Go ahead and watch my heart burn

Pop 'til it's vacant
Pop 'til the wrist pop
Pop 'til he shakin'
Pop like four on the floor been in rotation
No allegation
Popular demand, I understand  my name is only for conversation
New York nigga be like ""deadass""
L.A. nigga be like ""on the dead homies""
I was off the porch like Fed-Ex
211, got bread on me
K-Dot twilight the zeitgeist
Roll like fried rice and tempura shrimp
Temporary pimp, nah, don't remember them
Just canary yellow gem, jumping out the fuckin' gym
Swang like new Dana Dane, I ride dirty
Paid like two Damon Wayans, retire early
Fade like shadows, the stallion, the cattle
A bitches decision for you, is narrow
Collision, the money, and fame, the pharaoh
The physic, the chemist, the lame
Collateral for Kendrick whenever exchange
Compatible for riches with more to gain
I said, nigga, yeah right
I don't fair fight but I bear fight
Lookin' for my next roadkill for the headlight
Hangin' on my last four kills for the highlights
My life, hiii life, high five, bye, bye[Chorus: Vince Staples]

Made it out alive, God know my worth

Got 20 in my hand, got 20 on judge
Gave 20 to my dog, got 20 on girls

Bought a coupe with the spinnin' rims, get inside
Bring a friend, bleedin' hands from the genocide
Clean me up, beam me up to the other side
Brothers die, 'cause 'coons turn to butterflies
They don't wanna see me sittin' in the Benz
They don't wanna see me livin' on the end
Of the city in a citywide bend
Show no pity in the city full of sin

When I flex them tendons like rubber trees
Young Millie Jackson back to the shit
Mouthpiece drawn, got a verbal armory
Stack bodies, not figurines
Move beneath the surface, submarine
I'm half machine, obscene with a light sword
Look inside the brain, it's a riot in the psych ward
What you standing on the side for?
Roar like a lioness, punch like a cyborg
Spit slick, attack is subliminal
Flowers on my mind, but the rhyme style sinister
Stand behind my own bars, like a seasoned criminal
Gotham City Streets, I'll play the *bleep*
Crushing any system, that belittles us
Antidote to every poison they administer
Switch it like time signatures
Colors in my aura tend to cover the perimeter
Brown bodies that the blues wanna shoot through
Hi-res lasers wanna (zoom, zoom, zoom)
Wool over your eyes
My strength ain't nothing like my size
Blades on the top, Kathleen Cleaver
Tangle my cords like a weaver[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]

Gun squeezing, I'm a real Artesian
Ramona, I was round that corner
Still down, I'm a Norf Norf soldier
G slide right down do Sawyer
When we slide, you won't see morning
Another story of a young black man
Tryna make it up out that jam, god damn
Bag back, let me make my bands, got plans
If you hatin' don't shake my hand

From the sharks make me wanna put the hammer to my head
At the park politickin' with the kids
Tryna get em on a straight path, got the lames mad
Know they hate to see me make cash, got the space dash
In the foreign with the GPS addressed to your mama house
Compensation conversations what I'm all about
Took the smart route, never been marked out
Shoulda been dead broke, shoulda been chalked out
But it didn't happen, now it's time to get it cracking
Quarterbackin' like I'm 40 Water
Mix the holy water with the Voss
Wanna be the boss then you gotta pay the cost
Learned it from the Dogg I'm from Long Beach

Go in 'til they take my bro'nem out them CDCRs
Prison system broken, racial war commotion
Until the president get ashy, Vincent won't be votin'
We need Tamikas and Shaniquas in that Oval Office
Obama ain't enough for me, we only getting started
The next Bill Gates can be on Section 8 up in the projects
So 'til they love my dark skin
Bitch I'm goin' all in
[Hook]
Gas break 'n dip, the cash came, I flipped
And stacked that, yeah I stacked that past the ceiling

They found it
Depth close to 3,230 feet
A deep dive, but within acceptable range[Verse 3]
Clap your hands if the police ever profiled
You ain't gotta worry, don't be scary 'cause we on now
Ain't no gentrifying us, we finna buy the whole town
Tell the one percent to suck a dick, because we on now
We on now, we on now
Tell the one percent to suck a dick, because we on now
Tell the government to suck a dick, because we on now
Tell the president to suck a dick, because we on now
We on now

Vince Staples,Lift Me Up by Vince Staples,"[Intro]
Right now
Hey!
[Verse 1]
I'm just a nigga, until I fill my pockets
And then, I'm Mr Nigga, they follow me while shopping (Uh-huh)
I feel like Mick and Richards, they feel like Muddy Waters (Uh-huh)
So tell me, what's the difference? So tell me, what's the difference? (Hey)
My momma was a Christian, Crip-walking on blue waters
Was fading up to Davis, then walking back to Palmer
A fro like Huey partner, Auntie Angie had them choppers (Uh-huh)
So tell me, what's the difference? So tell me, what's the difference? (All right!)
I feel like ""Fuck Versace"", they raping niggas' pockets
And we don't get acknowledged, just thank me for the profit
A prophet just like Moses, and Moses looked like Shaka
Zulu, my .44 loaded, I'm aiming at Nirvana (Nirvana)
My bitch look like Madonna ('Donna), they staring at Katana
Waiter still ain't brought the chopsticks, should've brought the chopper (Whoo)
Uber driver in the cockpit look like Jeffrey Dahmer
But he looking at me crazy when we pull up to the projects
[Hook]
See, this weight is on my shoulders, pray, Jehovah, lift me up
And my pain is never over, pills and potions, fix me up
I just want to live it up, can a motherfucker breathe?
Life ain't always what it seems, so, please (Hey)
Just lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up
Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up
Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up
Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up (Say, man)
[Verse 2]
We love our neighborhood, so all my brothers bang the hood
I never vote for presidents, the presidents that change the hood
Is dead and green,
was standing on this mezzanine in Paris, France
Finna spaz 'cause most my homies never finna get this chance
All these white folks chanting when I asked 'em, ""Where my niggas at?"" (Uh-huh)
Going crazy, got me going crazy, I can't get with that
Wonder if they know I know they won't go where we kick it at
Ho, this shit ain't Gryffindor, we really killing, kicking doors (Hey)
Fight between my conscience and the skin that's on my body
Man, I need to fight the power, but I need that new Ferrari
Man, I breathe and bleed this Poppy Street
I shot them guns 'cause talk is cheap
Bow your head and pray, okay, now, walk with me (You know it)
[Hook]
See, this weight is on my shoulders, pray, Jehovah, lift me up
And my pain is never over, pills and potions, fix me up
I just want to live it up, can a motherfucker breathe?
(Can a motherfucker breathe?)
Life ain't always what it seems, so please (Hey)
Just lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up
Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up
Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up
Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up[Outro]
Lift me up, lift me, lift me up
Lift me, lift me up, lift me, lift me up
Lift me, lift me, lift me, lift me, lift me, lift me up
Lift me, lift me up, lift me, lift me up"

[Chorus 1]
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, maybe
Do you like the sunshine, do you like the snow?
Do you wanna talk about it, or be alone?
I think that you should know
That this could be forever, baby
[Verse 1]
Open up your eyes and tell me what you thinking
Open up your mind, and tell me what you seeing inside of me
Why we fussing, fucking up this evening?
I probably couldn't fix it if I knew the reason
Up on the sea, where I see you fallin' in the deep end
Is it love? I would really love to know the meaning
What's the grudge that you're holdin'? Hold my hand
Let me take you to the land where the ocean and the sands are meetin'
Look at the sun, all we need to see to know our freedom
Open up your heart
If we don't love, then we fall apart
[Chorus 2]
This could be forever, baby
I never seen you wetter, baby
Than when the tears fall, soakin' up your sweater, baby
I didn't mean harm—don't make me regret it, baby
[Bridge]
'Cause if I never knew you, I could never do this to you
Hope you understand
They never taught me how to be a man, only how to be a shooter
I only need the time to prove it
[Chorus 3]
'Cause this could be forever, baby
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, maybe
Do you like the sunshine, do you like the snow?
Do you wanna talk about it, or be alone?
I think that you should know
That this could be forever, baby
[Verse 2]
My teachers told me we was slaves
My mama told me we was kings
I don't know who to listen to
I guess we somewhere in between
My feelings told me love is real
But feelings known to get you killed
I feel as if I'm misconstrued
I spend my moments missing you
I'm searching for atonement
Do I blame my darker tone?
I know somethings are better left unsaid and people left alone
Pick up the phone
Don't leave me alone in this cruel, cruel world"
Dreamville,"Under the Sun by Dreamville, J. Cole & Lute (Ft. DaBaby)","[Intro: The Argo Singers & J. Cole]

Me nowhere
I done seen it all, oh my God

Nothing new under the sun, nobody fucking with son
I got a couple of sons, a couple of guns
A couple of niggas that bust up the party and fuck up the fun
She digging me and I’m cuffing her friend
She ig'-ing you while we fucking for fun
I got her suckin' her thumb, that’s my lil' baby
She call me daddy like grandmama baby
If this Sunday dinner, my hand on her gravy
I been on the craziest wave, if I'm on the stage
An M is my minimum wage
This ain't no kennel, behave
Niggas is with all that barking, we send 'em a stray
So in a way we the dogcatchers
How many bullets your dawg catchin'?
Sawed-off, raw dog fashion
Hauled off, hope God catch him, damn

I woke up for some money, ayy, lil' bitch
Too many opps in here, tell me who you with, ayy

Potato over my gun
I move in silence 'cause niggas be clocking my funds
When they should keep eye on they bitch ’cause baby girl coming with son
Niggas be judging my moves, but please tell me, what have you done?
My cousin might air out the party for fun
Pistol grips get to squeezing
Wish a nigga would like Liam Neeson
I don’t even need a reason, loyalty over treason
Bitch nigga, come and see me
Put some respect on my name
What side of my city I claim
I try to stay in my lane
Took my advance and put a Caprice on them thangs
I'm Beatties Ford ’til the wheels fall
Know some niggas probably pissed off
Who would thought I made it this far?
Gold Mouf, bitch, fuck 'em all
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I woke up for some money, ayy, lil' bitch
Too many opps in here, tell me who you with[Verse 3: DaBaby]
I just put diamonds on all of my teeth, now they probably think I ain't intelligent
In the homicide unit interrogation, asking questions, you know I ain’t tell 'em shit
Bitches call me a jock, all-American
I'm at the top of my class with my lettermen
I remember back in college, bitches knocking on my dorm door
I ain't never let 'em in
Now you know that that's cap, know I hit a few
Ain't no job, I'm selling gas like I'm Jiffy Lube
I had a freak, used to fuck while her boyfriend in class
I hit her from the back from like 10 to 2
No back and forth with these rappers
They mention me, dissin' me
No talkin' back, I won't mention you
Watch, when I come put that iron on your ass and I dip
They gon' want me to snitch in my interviews
I'm on fire, bitch, I'm lit, but I'm really cool
Don't acknowledge the shrimps when they ridicule
They don't come out after dark, bitch, I swim with the sharks
You ain't got enough heart, get a bigger pool
Wanna fight but he bigger, I ain't really trippin'
Reach under my shirt, grab a bigger tool
I got a Glock with a dick, let's get physical
They gon' be hollerin' out, ""Rip,"" and they missin' you
They got me started, I might as well finish it (Talk your shit)
I'm from Charlotte, you know how these niggas do

(Whatever I said, I don't know what I said, I don't give a fuck, ah)
Call some broads, we need to get a whole carload
(You gettin' this? You recording this?)
With my dawgs, we pull up looking like a car show
(Are you getting this?)
Smoke a blunt and then she get up off my narcos (Woo, yeah)
[Verse 3: Johnny Venus & Guapdad 4000]
Roses is falling, the money is calling, I'll pedal forever and ever to you
TEC in the boxes of chocolate, I'll send 'em, I'll ship 'em, I'll get 'em delivered to you
Baby, whatever, just come on, just hop in the getaway car and we'll go and get food
Sky is dissolving or falling, whatever, just tell 'em the teller better not make a move (Hey)
[Verse 4: Guapdad 4000]
Skrrt skrrt in a new thing
Throw the cash 'til she get her Raekwon like the Wu-Tang
I think I deserve me a Mulsanne
Me, you, and two or three hoes should do the group thing
Just don't fuck up the sheets, the Airbnb, and fuck off the lease
Bitch, mind your bees, I need peace of mind
I beat meat, delete, then be leavin' fine, let's go
[Chorus: Buddy, JID, Johnny Venus, & Guapdad 4000]
Get my gun, we 'bout to rob a Wells Fargo
Call some broads, we need to get a whole carload
With my dawgs, we pull up looking like a car show
Smoke a blunt and then she get up off my narcos (Woo)[Outro: Johnny Venus]

Dreamville,LamboTruck by Dreamville & Cozz (Ft. Childish Major & REASON),"[Chorus: Childish Major]
Ayy, what's those? You want these
You gotta have fees plus more
So much heat you can't hold
A lotta green, kind that can't fold
What's those? You want these
Gotta have fees plus more
So much heat you can't hold
Whole lotta green, kind that can't fold
[Verse 1: Cozz]
Oh yeah
Lookin' great but feeling bummy
I just ate, but still I'm hungry
I got something, but I ain't nothing
Brother tummy isn't chubby
Bills like nymphos, they keep coming
Always something, something, something
Copped some things but I ain't fed
Dreams alive, my wallet dead
Pockets been bleeding
I got a reason to commit treason
But I'ma hit REASON and see what he think
About how he's been treated at TDE
'Cause I done been scheming
ScHoolboy just dropped, give me the cue
I'm desperate enough to go do what it do
SZA done popped and y'all got Dot
I heard Jay Rock has been moving them units
Soul and Isaiah Rashad, boy, you niggas really up at the top
Almost thought about popping a Glock
But a nigga ain't stupid and I ain't a shooter
But who really is until they provoked?
Nigga, this hunger got me finna choke
Starting to think that this isn't a joke
Gave up the liquor, I'm bringing the smoke
I talked to Bas, we fiending for more
A nigga done tried speaking to Cole
He be too busy but he be the bro
Shit, fuck it, I know how it go
So if I can't get a response from my label
And get some more food on my table
We can turn this thing into a fable
And take what I can if I'm able

Ayy, what's those? You want these

Never need towels, no teammate
Drink some Jamie, I can't see straight
Cheese like Green Bay, roger that
New West niggas, me and Cozz been that
Good weed bring a nigga asthma back
Getting good bread, got my wallet stacked
Lately, been spinning like laundromats
Lately, I been seeing all kinds of black
Wait, look, I'm lying, look
Cozz, look, I done been broke too long
Nigga bills too long, can't hide that, nigga
Cole just pulled up in a Lamborghini truck
On the homies and God, we should rob that nigga[Verse 3: Cozz & REASON]
Rob that nigga?
Yeah, rob that nigga
Look, Rob, my nigga
You could try, but Cole ain't a thot, my nigga
Wait Cozz, I ain't sayin' he a thot, my nigga
Look, let me explain
We could tie Ib up
Throw him in the back of a Lamborghin' truck
Cole do something, we could let a Glock squeeze up
Wait chill, ease up
I ain't really trying to get involved, my nigga, look
We ain't got the same father or mother, but that's my brother
Can't cross my nigga
Shit, well I'm Top Dawg, my nigga, so
I ain't gotta pay a cost, my nigga
Your loss, my nigga, just don't off that nigga
Shit, fuck it, I'll stop
Look, let's make a deal
While I go and rob Cole, you go rob Top
Cool
[Outro: REASON]
Picture me having what they told me I should have
I've been living off some scraps, I done sold a couple packs
I been smoking potent, sippin' slow, fuck you think I'm in it for?
I'm just tryna make a bag
I'll be damned if I ain't make a bag
Thinking slow, living fast
Nice guys finish last
West Coast, getting cash

Just a couple West niggas, we gon' show you how to rob"

Like a motherfuckin’ lamp
[Verse: J. Cole]
Smoke in my nappy dreads, how you scared to die, nigga?
Don't believe that lie, I think that everybody happy dead
Hell is a fabricated figment of imagination
I done seen worse for real right there off Yadkin behind gas station
Cambridge Homes, 'partments where the girls get damaged young
From overexposure to the vultures
That prey on them like pastors is supposed to
If they wasn't so concerned about the tags that's on they clothes, but
Guess that's how it goes, fuck it, what do I know?
Ain't been in service since Jim Jones had somethin' with Hov
I document my life with rap beefs, love songs, favorite albums
In years that my niggas got blood on they sneakers from bodies they might’ve caught
I don’t judge no one, I'm just knowin’
At night, when it get quiet, that shit could fuck with 'em
And if it don't right now, it's gon’ catch up to 'em
Guilt heavy as a cloud in a thunderstorm, huh
My niggas blowing loud like an elephant
It's helpin' 'em to cope,
I don't do nothin' if it don't
Make somethin', make a dollar
Make me wonder, make me prouder
Make me karma, make me better
I ain't no killer, don't make me have to, nigga
You want my spot, well maybe after, nigga
So active on the radio, I'm radioactive, nigga
That's a bar, I had to give it to 'em
Never slouching, not even on couches in the living room
And I feel like the world is ending soon
Is the ending good or bad? Well that's depending on you
And if you wake up in time
I know it's better to be sleep, that's why we hate the alarm
I feel you[Chorus: Zoink Gang]
Oh wow (Oh wow, oh wow)
She got a big old ass (She got a big old butt), I'm proud (What?)

Southwest Murder Block Crips, we don't die, we multiply (Crip)
Maxo talk a lot of shit but is he really 'bout that life? (Say what?)
Is a pig's pussy pork and can a caterpillar fly? (That's right)
Go Go Gadget, toting ratchets, beam attachment on the side
I keep a savage that'll blast it, my crash dummies down to ride
These niggas janky than a bitch, I do my shit up on my lonely
So I can't trust you on a lick if you not Nina, Mac, or Tommy
Traphouse serving like hibachi, Draco, chopstick, baby AK
Different flavors like Tekashi, twelve gauge shotty like I'm Tr3yway
Maxo Kobe, holy moly, servin' Smokey like I'm Day-Day
Runnin' out of dog food like I fed Chico
Put a brick on your head and get you dropped like Deebo
I'm slangin' bricks like Craig, I'm tryna drop these bows

If I keep moving like this, then I'ma glide
Happy on the outside, jealous on the inside

[Verse: J. Cole &
DJ Drama
]
With every record, I be asking the masses to tune your hearts to me
I represent intelligent niggas that grew up harshly
But lately I've been questioning, second guessing, whether or not I've got something to offer since I done eluded poverty
Or has the money watered me down, that truth is hard for me
Like the second time I got cut from the junior varsity
Fightin' back tears, I promised to switch gears
And said to myself ""Whatever you do, you won't do it partially""
From this day forward, I move with a new ferocity
Ferrari coupe velocity, a fail-proof philosophy
Success is in the effort, so if a nigga tried his hardest
I'm at peace knowing God ain't deal it in this group of cards for me
Some people say that I'm running third, they threw the bronze at me
Behind Drake and Dot, yeah, them niggas is superstars to me
Maybe deep down, I'm afraid of my luminosity
So when you see me on red carpets, I'm movin' awkwardly
Posin' all nervous, afraid of the judgement
And the thought of showin' too much of my day is repugnant
I be keepin' my kids away from the gaze of the public
'Cause these days, it feel like hate is they favorite subject
Fuck it, attitude like a young O'Shea with a AK
Aimed at your brain, violate, and I bust it
I don't play when it come to family, that's one thing I refuse
Pimpin' they kids out for views or just to be in the news
Could never be me, I piss in the celebrity tea
God with me on this record, this is Heaven's EP
The tale's official, the best nigga breathing, it just failed to hit you
You couldn't tell 'cause you fell for the bells and whistles
And that's an area I don't excel
I'm from the 'Ville where young girls talk grown as hell
That's raw, never saw one person go to Yale
But every nigga that I know done gone to jail
At least once, provin' we the ones police hunt
For the pains, we smoke three blunts the size of tree trunks
Too much hunger, it's no wonder these niggas can't keep up
So saying ""Yes"" to a feature just means I'm 'bout to eat lunch, bitch
I'm goin' for it, no never shall he punt
I'm the one and you can be sure, speaking of beachfront
I'm kickin' my feet up while I write this in somewhere tropical
Supposed to be relaxin', this passion makes that impossible, mm

Making crack rocks outta pussy nigga fishbones (Haha)

For a fuckin' shrink, sheesh, I already got mine
And he's not fuckin' workin', I think I'm wastin' my damn time
I'm clockin' three past six and goin' postal
This the revenge of the dicks, that's nine cocks that cock 9's
This ain't no V. Tech shit, or Columbine
But after bowling,
I went home for some damn Adventure Time
(What'd you do?) I slipped myself some pink Xannies (Yeah)
And danced around the house in all-over print panties
My mom's gone, that fuckin' broad will never understand me
I'm not gay, I just wanna boogie to some Marvin
(What you think of Hayley Williams?)
Fuck her, Wolf Haley robbin' them
I'll crash that fuckin' airplane that that faggot nigga B.o.B is in
And stab Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus
And won't stop until the cops come in
I'm an overachiever, so how about I start a team of leaders
And pick up Stevie Wonder to be the wide receiver? (Cool)
Green paper, gold teeth, and pregnant golden retrievers
All I want, fuck money, diamonds, and bitches, don't need 'em
But where the fat ones at? I got somethin' to feed 'em
It's some cooking books, the black kids never wanted to read 'em
Snap back, green ch-ch-chia fuckin' leaves
It's been a couple months
And Tina still ain't perm her fuckin' weave

They say success is the best revenge
So I beat DeShay up with the stack of magazines I'm in
Oh, not again, another critic writing report
I'm stabbin' any bloggin' faggot hipster with a pitchfork
Still suicidal, I am
I'm Wolf, Tyler put this fuckin' knife in my hand
I'm Wolf, Ace gon' put that fuckin' hole in my head
And I'm Wolf, that was me who shoved a cock in your bitch
(What the fuck, man?) Fuck the fame and all the hype, G
I just wanna know if my father would ever like me
But I don't give a fuck, so he's probably just like me
A motherfuckin' goblin

Then it bunny-hopped off my shoulder, now my conscience dead
Now the only guidance that I had is splattered on cement

That's the only time we make up, make up
You exist behind my eyelids, my eyelids
Now, I don't wanna wake up

Wonder if you look both ways when you cross my mind

I can only see your face when I close my eyes

Stop the waiting 'fore I stop the chasing, like an alcoholic
""You don't understand me""—what the fuck do you mean?
It's them rose-tinted cheeks, yeah, it's them dirt-colored eyes
Sugar-honey iced tea, bumblebee on the scene
Yeah, I'd give up my bakery to have a piece of your pie
Ugh!

For example, ten minutes can't go past without you brushing my thoughts
That's fourteen forty a day so I'll say a hundred and forty-four times
I think about you or something like that
Lost match, the fucking thought of you with somebody else
I don't like that; cellular convos getting left in the wrong
'Cause I get so fucking mad when you don't write back

Actually, if you even consider leaving
I'll lose a couple screws in due time, I'll stop breathin'
And you'll see the meaning of stalkin'
When I pop out the dark to find you
And that new dude that you're seein' with an attitude
Then proceed to fuck up your evenin'
Make sure you never meet again like goddamn vegans
'Cause when I hear your name, I cannot stop cheesin'
I love you so much that my heart stops beatin' when you're leavin'
And I'm grievin' and my heart starts bleedin'
Life without you has no goddamn meanin'
Sorry, I'm passive-aggressive for no goddamn reason
It's that my mood change like these goddamn seasons

A real ninja, with the blade and the mask
Had them gold ninja stars, and red Supreme nunchuks
Now she tryna patch me up, but

You can tell me all your problems like I really give one (Nope)

Don't wanna seem like a punk pussy that simps over punk pussy
See when I'm with my friends I just put on a front
But in the back of my top, I'm writing songs about we
We, as including I, and yourself, making three
Little ones,
the drums are hitting pretty hard if you ask me
You're a pretty broad in the top three
Of things that I've been waiting to come, so
Meet me by the lake around 10 and skinny dippin' and then
We can begin the pretend game, I wanna be Finn from Adventure Time[Chorus: Frank Ocean]

I just wanna drag your lifeless body to the forest
And fornicate with it
But that's because I'm in love with you, cunt

Ayo, take one look in the mirror, implications so clear
I live life with no fear, except for the idea
That one day you won't be here
I will not fetch the ball
Eyes are green, I eat my vegetables
It has nothin' to do with that broad
But if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well
I got a plan, 'bout to walk in the pen
If you can't understand, I'm a hawk in the gym
Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest
That I need to get off, or I ain't talkin' to them
Can't be in the picture if it got no frame
Gon' let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame
Blow the whole spot up, 'cause I ain't–
I wanna share last names, I wanna be your number one
Not the other one, keep it on the low
I'm in my right mind, keep it on a high
Janis Joplin spillin' feelings, now I'm out here moppin' 'em
Four on the floor, pack up your bags, we hit the store
Grab our supplies, no need for masks, bust through the door
Get the job done like retirement, I admit you look concerned

That I got love for my mother, none of you other fuckers
Are much important, I'm getting angrier while recording
I'm feeling like the bulls, I've got a gang of wolves
Odd Future is children that's fucked up in they mental
Simple, but probably not, fuck em
[Verse 3]
I'm tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck
Drunk white girls: the only way I'll get my dick sucked
Suspended from school, coolest nigga without effort
Easy to spot, like black bitches with fake leopard
Soak me up in a tampon, but keep the lamp on
'Cause this album pack enough evil
That you can't fit inside a Jansport
Go to school with this
[Verse 4]
I go from AP to JC inside a fucking week
Waking up with random girls like ""Yo, bitch, how the fuck we meet?""
I stay with grandma, she always bitching about her carpet
Every time I walk inside the house, she always tend to start shit
No to drugs, I never spark it,
I used to be bullied for honor classes
By those that were slow as molasses
Take this shit to school[Verse 5]
Raquel treat me like my father, like a fucking stranger
She still don't know I made ""Sarah"" to strangle her
Not put her in danger and chop her up in the back of a Wrangler
All because she said no to homecoming,
demons running
Inside my heads telling me evil thoughts
I'm the dream catcher but nothing but nightmares are caught,
go to sleep
[Verse 6]
I wear green hats because I'm fortunately lucky
""Fuck me,"" the monster said, somehow the monster's dead
Inside of me, but the thoughts it tells me are still evil
With this state of mind, big moves, Max Keeble
I'm on my grind feeble,
my music is either
A fucking sin or too illegal, play this shit in church
[Verse 7: Tyler, The Creator, Dr. TC]
I graduated without honors or fucking father
He died (
I'm so sorry
) No bitch, don't even fucking bother
I wanted a brother, my mother I told her
But instead I got a sister, just like me with her mister nada
So both of our imaginations are creations of the fucking situation
That's having our brains racing like Dayton
Wearing some fucking Heelys
[Verse 8]
I know you fucking feel me, I want to fucking kill me
But times I'm so serious, you think I'm silly
I'm doing Big Style Willy couldn't touch 11
Seven, what's religion nigga? I am legend
I roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition
I created O.F. cause I feel we're more talented
Than 40 year old rappers talking about Gucci
When they have kids they haven't seen in years
Impressing their peers
With the same problem, the only way to solve them
Is to go to Father's Day convention with a gold revolver
Life's a salad, I'm a toss it, eat that shit up, Rick Ross it
Shit it out, bag it up, sell it, I'm so damn rebellious
Cause my mother let me do what I want
She wasn't careless, protective she is the bear
The shit is so bare, my diary isn't hid
My father didn't give a fuck, so it's something I inherit
My mom is all I have so it's never meet the parents
When Danielle or Milan decide to fucking share
This confused boy, I wanna hug, oy
I’m bad for your kids to listen to
, s
oy is not the choice
I'm bad milk, drink it[Interlude: Dr. TC]
Whoa, umm, it seems you had a lot to say
Uh, who knows I might feel as I'm evaluating
[Verse 9]
My wrist is all red from the cutter
Dripping cold blood like the winter,
the summer
Is never that's equivalent to me and Sarah
Well that's not her fucking name, but I think this shit is clever
My niggas wanna know if I'm fucking, if I'm kissing
But I'm sitting here downing beers simply just wishing
With a tear they try to tell me but I never listen
'Cause I don't give a shit like sitting down pissing
Eighteen, still talking to imaginaries
Hopefully they see the talent I carry just like Jimmy
Losers can never win me, you can never offend me
My goal in life is a Grammy, hopefully mom'll attend the
Ceremony with all my homies,
I'm suicidal
This my Zombie Circus
, I hope the majors heard this
Fuck a deal, I just want my father's email
So I can tell him how much I fucking hate him in detail
[Outro: Dr. TC]
Wow, umm
So, Tyler, if you had the chance to tell him something
What would you tell him?"

Choppa got the chopper, make 'em do a backflip
Pay my dawg a dime to walk him down, he need the racks, bitch
I been drinkin', I been taking all this codeine to the face
Got a lot of M's in the safe
Caught a murder, then I beat the case
I was just about to do the race[Chorus: NLE Choppa]
Uh, posted (Posted), in front of the trap (Front the trap)
Selling dope 'til the sun come down (Come down)
Take a fuck nigga right off the map (Off the map)
When I hit him with this whole hundred rounds (A hundred rounds)
Yung Joc, in the club with my Glock (With my Glock)
You want to play, and then this bitch going down (It's goin' down)
We ain't hesitatin', bullets get to blazin' (Get to blazin')
I'ma lay him down like he in the lounge
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down"

Yeah, huh

Huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hahaha

Yeah, yeah, hrrroww
Bow, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
I'm tired of him breathing, I'm taking his breath (Huh?)
Shoot to my right, my flag on the left
I earned my stripes but I'm not a ref
These niggas, they woke, they overslept (Yeah)
My bitch, she clutch because she a nurse
Whenever I'm down she give me a perc
The police pull up, my gun in her purse
The ops pull up, put him on a shirt
Bitch, we came in this world and we lookin' for murder
Knock yo cap off and it's word to Bobby Shmurda
Nigga watch yo mouth, I would hate to have to hurt ya
You would kill off a perc but snitch when you sober
Man down in the street, man, this nigga tried to play me
I hit one in the head but his gun was on safety
They askin' how I been, what I been feelin' lately
I got good aim in the pocket like I'm Brady
[Verse 1]
Can't speak on the shit I did to you
To be honest, them bullets wasn't meant for you
I'm sorry that they hit you
Fuck that, spin again, shoot the friend too
See at first I was gon' stop and chill
Hell nah, how them hollows feel?
I'm independent, can't sign a deal
Won't sell out for a couple mill
Before you try and rob, hit yo knees and pray to Buddha
Soon as you up it, Lil Trey gonna shoot ya
Remember I was young and I used to be a hoopa
I got into guns then I turned to the shoota
Knock off yo head, call that a fuckin' train wreck
Bitch, close yo legs, Where the fuck is yo brain at?
Wet a nigga block, make it look like we painted
Man I used to struggle, now a nigga famous
[Verse 2]
I'm 16, with big dreams, I wanna be a star
I used to spend money on lil things, now I want a car
Aye, that Rollie or that Audemars, Where do I start?
Man this lean fuckin' up my tummy,
makin' me fart
Hunnid-sumthn shots in the rental
My bitch, she bad, like Kendall
I'm poppin' niggas like pimple
I'm in her mouth, that's dental
We strapped up like a gay ho
We kill niggas like Tadoe
We ruthless like Fredo and love totin' Dracos
Mop a nigga with the .40, I'm a janitor
We smokin' on gas, that's cannabis
That's a lot in the Draco, I'm a animal
In Florida, chillin' in Panama
He said he want smoke, I hope that he ready
I put on my mask like Jason and Freddy
You soft as a bear, just like Teddy
I shoot him in the head, knock out his spaghetti (Yeah)[Chorus]
I'm tired of him breathing, I'm taking his breath (Huh?)
Shoot to my right, my flag on the left
I earned my stripes but I'm not a ref
These niggas, they woke, they overslept (Yeah)
My bitch, she clutch because she a nurse
Whenever I'm down she give me a perc
The police pull up, my gun in her purse
The opps pull up, put him on a shirt
Bitch, we came in this world and we lookin' for murder
Knock yo cap off and it's word to Bobby Shmurda
Nigga watch yo mouth, I would hate to have to hurt ya
You would kill off a perc but snitch when you sober
Man down in the street, man, this nigga tried to play me
I hit one in the head but his gun was on safety
They askin' how I been, what I been feelin' lately
I got good aim in the pocket like I'm Brady"

NLE the top shotta
I got the bomb like Al-Qaeda
[Chorus]
Get a bitch and make her famous, next minute she block me
Thirty in this Perky, need to slow down on the Roxys
Got a call, my nigga died, I damn near skipped a heartbeat
Lookin' for your love, but your feelings is departing
Pull up on the wrong street,
you niggas getting blicked out
Gun up in my hand while I fuck her with my dick out
We was really in the trenches, thuggin' in the Choppa house
Don't you tell me that it's smoke, because you know that we gon' bang it out
[Verse]
I don't even know which car I'ma drive (Drive)
Roll a three-five, now I'm too damn high (I'm too damn high)
Bitch, I'm in my zone, don't you kill my vibe (Don't you kill my vibe)
If a nigga play, you know them choppers gon' ride
That micro Draco clip, it look like a banana
(Like a banana)
A nigga look wrong in this bitch, we gonna blam him (Grr, grr, grr, grr, grr)
A lot of choppers when we ride, raise the count up (Raise the count up)
I robbed the corner store, the gun over the counter
And I ain't gotta spin back because I know he dead
Ain't no surviving when you shoot a nigga right in his head
Paramedics asking questions 'bout that boy and the meds
But they know he ain't gon' make it, so they pronounced him dead
[Chorus]
Get a bitch and make her famous, next minute she block me
Thirty in this Perky, need to slow down on the Roxys
Got a call, my nigga died, I damn near skipped a heartbeat
Lookin' for your love, but your feelings is departing
Pull up on the wrong street, you niggas getting blicked out
Gun up in my hand while I fuck her with my dick out
We was really in the trenches, thuggin' in the Choppa house
Don't you tell me that it's smoke, because you know that we gon' bang it out
[Outro]
They gon' feel me, NLE the motherfuckin'...
NLE the top shotta, yeah
Pull up on the wrong street, you niggas getting blicked out
Gun up in my hand while I fuck her with my dick out
We was really in the trenches thuggin' in the Choppa house
Don't you tell me that it's smoke, because you know that we gon' make it out"
