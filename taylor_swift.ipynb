      "we think we know someone  but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us. we know our friend in a certain light  but we don't know them the way their lover does. just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. their mother knows them differently than their roommate  who knows them differently than their colleague. their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. and yet  a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd  nothing more. we may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. we may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip.\n",
      "this is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet  and together we will all discover the after effects of that. ultimately  we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. but then we wake up  look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes  and cringe. we hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future  their partner  their forever. someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story  all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you.\n",
      "the point being  despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life  humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. we are never just good or just bad. we are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves  our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party  existing somewhere between our well lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. we are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity  loyalty and self preservation  pragmatism and impulsiveness.\n",

      "real life is a funny thing  you know. in real life  saying the right thing at the right moment is beyond crucial. so crucial  in fact  the most of us start to hesitate  for fear of saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. but lately what i've begun to fear more than that is letting the moment pass without saying anything.\n",

      "the debate over whether people change is an interesting one for me to observe because it seems like all i ever do is change. all i ever do is learn from my mistakes so i don't make the same ones again. then i make new ones. i know people can change because it happens to me little by little every day. every day i wake up as someone slightly new. isn't it wild and intriguing and beautiful to think that every day we are new \n",
      "for the last few years  i've woken up every day not wanting  but needing to write a new style of music. i needed to change the way i told my stories and the way they sounded. i listened to a lot of music from the decade in which i was born and i listened to my intuition that it was a good thing to follow this gut feeling. i was also writing a different storyline than i'd ever told you before.\n",
